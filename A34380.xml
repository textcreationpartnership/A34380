            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Shewing, That ſuch as will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt needs ſuffer afflictions.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are all prone by nature to decline afflictions, each one ſuppoſing to finde out ſome backe way to eſcape them. Firſt, Some are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that they can quit themſelves by playing the Temporizers; Secondly, Others, by hiding and concealing themſelves; Thirdly, Another ſort, by flying from thoſe places where Tyrants vexe and domineere; Fourthly, a fourth, thinking to beare off blowes by their greatnes and credit they have gotten in the world; Fifthly and laſtly, a fifth ſort imagining to find ſome evaſion, either by reaſon of their allyes, or good ſervices which they have done; dreaming forſooth, that either theſe or the like projects ſhould yeeld them good reſpect, and preſerve them from being called into queſtion by thoſe that hate them. In a word, which of us hath not ſome fetch or other to breake looſe, if he ſhould be either examined or purſued?</p>
               <p>This is the true cauſe that ſo few are prepared, and carefull timely to foreſee what belongs to ſuffering ſhame and diſgrace for the truth, as the diſcommodities of long im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, or what appertaines to the conſtant and patient bearing of hideous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and death for the cauſe of the Goſpell. But alas, all theſe are but as fig leaves, and vaine hopes, which being ſomwhat pleaſing to the fleſh do only dull and deceive us; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us to grow ſecure and careleſſe, and ſo unprovided to ſuffer, till we be ſurpriſed, and in ſafe cuſtody in our enemies hands. So that, when we ſhould be able to give a reaſon <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 15.</note> of the hope that is in us, we have not a word to ſay.</p>
               <p>To prevent theſe ſo great inconveniences, let us hold this for a ſure principle, That it is impoſſible to live godly, and not ſuffer perſecution. For God hath ſo decreed, that <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 12. Rom. 8. 20.</note> if we will partake of the glory of his Sonne, we muſt firſt be conformed to him in his
<pb facs="tcp:65665:3"/> ſufferings. Yea, this is that ſtrait gate and narrow way which leadeth unto life. Through <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 14.</note> much tribulation we muſt enter into the Kingdome of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 22. and whoſoever beares not the Croſſe of Chriſt, following him, cannot be his Diſciple. The Apoſtle in <note place="margin">Luke 14. 27. Heb. 12. 7.</note> the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> plainly tels us, That if we be children, wee muſt taſte of that diſcipline which God nurtures his withall in his Family. It is and muſt be the portion of Gods beloved ones, to live in this world as ſheep amongſt wolves. <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, if wee could live without ſin, we might then conceive ſome hope of freedome from the Croſſe. But whileſt corrupt nature lives in us, and brings forth ſuch bitter fruits, God hath, and will in all ages raiſe up ſome Tyrant or other, as means to mortifie and tame the pride and rebellion thereof. Devils may as ſoone ceaſe to be, as that enmity ſhould ceaſe between the ſeed of the woman and the ſeed of the ſerpent. As long as the <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15. Mat. 8. 24.</note> Church continues to be Chriſts poore Barque in the ſalt ſea of this world, ſhe muſt make her account to be toſſed with ſtorms and tempeſts of perſecutions.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſay, no Crowne is to be expected in Heaven, if we will not fight the <note place="margin">2 Tim. 47. Pſal. 126. 5. 2 Cor. 4 10.</note> good fight of faith here on earth; nor to reap in joy, if in this world we refuſe to ſow in teares: The life of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt cannot be manifeſt in us, except we beare about in our body the dying of the Lord Ieſus.</p>
               <p>Let every Chriſtian then hold this for certaine, That when the world ceaſeth to hate the Children of God, and the Devill to envy them, then may they looke, and not before, to live in the world without perſecutions.</p>
               <p>Hath not the Way, the Life, and the Truth ſaid it? In the world you ſhall have tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. <note place="margin">Iohn 16. 33.</note> And therefore let not the great ones of the World thinke to be exempted out of this ranke, more than the ſmall: For to the Saints and members of the true Church affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are even as ordinary, as is Baptiſme, Faith, and the Spirit of Adoption.</p>
               <p>Was not <hi>Moſes</hi> the adopted ſonne of <hi>Pharaobs</hi> daughter, ſaine to ſly out of Aegypt to <note place="margin">Exod. 2. 15. Act. 7. 29. Heb. 11. 27. 1 Sam. 26. 20: Saint <hi>Iereme</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon Iſaiah. Dan 6. 16.</note> ſave his life? Was not <hi>David,</hi> though anointed King, hunted by <hi>Saul</hi> his purſuer as a Partridge into the mountaines? <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were of the bloud Royall, yet they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped not; the one, from being cruelly rent in ſunder with a Saw, after he had preached to his Nation ſixty yeares; nor the other (although next unto the King he ſwayed the affairs of the Babyloniſh Empire) to be caſt into the lyons den.</p>
               <p>In the times of the great perſecutions under <hi>Diocleſian</hi> the Emperour of Rome, who were the firſt that were ſacrificed, but <hi>Nicomede,</hi> and the principall Favourites of the Court? Who is ignorant that two of the moſt noble Princes of our times that ever Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many had, notwithſtanding their munition and meanes, were taken priſoners by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, or held captive five or ſix yeares in great diſtreſſe? What ſhould I here mention Lady <hi>Iane Gray</hi> proclaimed Queene of England, and yet cruelly put to death? Or <hi>Thomas Cranmer,</hi> Primate of England, burned to aſhes at Oxford? Or the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and valiant Knight, hanged, and burned hanging in Saint <hi>Giles</hi> in the fields? All theſe, with many more, were apprehended, and not long after put to death, even then when they might ſeeme moſt to have flouriſhed in the World.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that neither age, ſex, power nor place can ſecure us from ſuffering, which are every where foretold in the holy Scriptures to abide us, whether wee be high or low, <note place="margin">Act. 20. 23.</note> let us in the name and feare of God prepare to take up the Croſſe of Chriſt betimes; learne we of the ſilly Ant in Summer to ſtore up food againſt the cold and ſtormy Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Prov. 6. 6.</note> of Affliction: Imitating thoſe who dwelling in defenced cities are carefull to provide themſelves of munition before they be beſieged.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as afflictions are thus neceſſary and inevitable to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that whether they will or no, they muſt paſſe this ſtrait way: they ought to bethinke them how to make hard things eaſie. And herein to follow the dealing of the Phyſitian with his patient, who, intending to give him ſome bitter Potion or Pill, is wont to ſweeten the one with Syrrup, and to wrap up the other in gold, leſt he ſhould abhor to take in, or ſwallow downe, either the one or the other. Even ſo are we, by committing to memory ſome elect and choice ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of holy Scriptures concerning the Croſſe, to cover over the ſame therewith, that it may not appeare ſo dreadfull unto us, as we apprehend it to be. For that which cauſeth us to fly and feare perſecution, is a prejudicate opinion we have conceived in our mindes, that ſome deadly poiſon lurks under it. And therefore wee ſhun ſo much as to taſte a little ſup thereof, in regard we imagine it to be the only bitter drug in the world.</p>
               <p>Now, that which makes us fall into, and breeds in us this error, is becauſe (as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſo almoſt in all things elſe) we are led rather by ſenſe, than by the word, by which wee ought to ballance and regulate all our perſwaſions and reſolutions. For could we beleeve what the Prophets and Apoſtles (inſpired of God) have preached and written for the uſe of poſterity, as touching perſecutions, wee would not onely have them in a more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſteeme, but thankfully and patiently beare them.</p>
               <p>To which end, let us endeavour firmly to imprint in our minds theſe and the like ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, that if we be reproached for the name of Chriſt, we may think our ſelves happy; for the ſpirit of glory and of God (ſaith he) reſteth upon you. And <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 14. Rom. 5. 3.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of himſelfe and his aſſociates, ſaith thus, And not onely ſo, but we glory in tribulation alſo, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, &amp;c. And in another place, God forbid that I ſhould glory ſave in the croſſe of our <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 14.</note> Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Theſe places, with ſundry others to the ſame purpoſe, doe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently manifeſt how much the true Chriſtian ought to thinke himſelfe honored of God, when it pleaſeth him to call ſuch an one forth to ſuffer for his name in the defence of his Truth.</p>
               <p>What other thing elſe, I pray you, was the cauſe of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> glorying, and that <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 7, 8. Hoſ. 13. 14.</note> glory in an higher degree, which Chriſt hath ordained for us by his death; with which glory he is now invironed in the kingdome of his father? What elſe is it which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the Elect, as a recompence of their faith in Gods promiſes and all their loyall <note place="margin">Iſa. 24. 16.</note> ſervices, but glory to the righteous? What is the principall glory which we attribute to the Martyrs? Is it not in regard of their invincible patience and conſtancy of faith, by which they overcame the world and their owne fleſh, which is not to be eſteemed a ſmall or meane victory?</p>
               <p>If <hi>Alexander</hi> obtained ſo great renowne by conquering <hi>Darius;</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> for diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Hannibal,</hi> &amp;c. who ſlew but a few mortall men like themſelves; how much are wee, in compariſon of them, to admire their valour, who have not onely warred againſt men, but againſt their threats, gibbets, fires, yea againſt death it ſelfe, and in the end trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed over it?

               <p>If that which <hi>Cicero</hi> writes be true, That no vertue gives to man greater Iuſtre than <note place="margin">In his book of Offices.</note> Magnanimity, we may thence ſafely conclude, That none ought in this kinde to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before a Chriſtian Martyr; who neither loves, deſires, or admires ought, ſave that which is honeſt and praiſeworthy, nor gathers any riches to himſelfe but what he knows to be laſting, and hopes to poſſeſſe for ever in the Kingdome of Heaven: and therefore ſleighting either mens favours or diſpleaſures, as thoſe that are high borne contemne the one, when they ſeem to ſmile, and are not much daunted with the frowns of the other, knowing right well that all things under the Sun are but vanity, and ſubject to change with their ages and ſeaſons.</p>

                  <hi>Abraham</hi> never performed a more honourable act, than in offering up his ſon <hi>Iſaac</hi> at Gods command, nor for which he is more praiſed.

               <p>The Biſhops of old had ſuch an honourable eſteem of martyrdome, that they prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it before their Epiſcopall dignities; ſo as both themſelves, and their Diſciples and followers whom they had taught, were ſo ambitious thereof, that when they wanted op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſuffer, being excluded therefrom by the interceding of friends, or were not the firſt that ſuffered, they took it ſo to heart, that ſome of them carried the grief there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to their graves.</p>

               <p>Good God?

                  </gap>f them. Examples whereof we have in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and ſundry others; who, by the afflictions they ſuffered for righteouſneſſe ſake, were prepared (in that which God had appointed) the one to be Governour over the land of Aegypt, the other over the kingdome of Iſrael. For as in the time of warre, a Captaine or a Generall <note place="margin">Three ſimilies</note> of an army, takes occaſion there to let his ſouldiers ſee his fidelity, vigilancy, fortitude and skill he hath in leading them out and in; and as a Phyſitian among the ſicke and diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, is occaſioned to exerciſe the profundity of his art and experience he hath atchieved; Or as friends, when we are in diſtreſſe, doe give us to underſtand what love they beare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and how mindfull they are of us; Even ſo, or much more, doth God declare how greatly he loveth us, and how faithfull he is in performing his promiſes, in the time of our diſtreſſes, which is no meane benefit.</p>
               <p>For the experience which we get from his bounty, love, power, and care of our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, cauſeth us with greater confidence to ſtay and reſt our ſelves wholly upon him; and the tryall alſo of his fidelity doth more and more confirme us in waiting for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his promiſes, which conſequently occaſionshim to accompliſh the ſame in us.</p>
               <p>Againe, had we no other good for which wee ought to rejoyce in afflictions, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome our ſelves to beare them both patiently and thankfully, but this, that they ſerve to ſet forth Gods glory, which after a ſort ſhines in us, while during our troubles he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds us in them, and in due time delivers us out of them; what can we deſire more? For his glory ought to be ſo deare unto us, that if our damnation it ſelfe might be a means to advance it, we ſhould not refuſe to undergoe it, but freely and willingly offer our ſelves to be caſt into hell. Subjects and ſervants joy in nothing more than in ſeeing their lords and maſters highly honoured, as on the contrary nothing vexeth them more, than when they ſee them diſeſteemed, or ought to be broached tending to the impeaching or obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their eſtimation or honour. Shall we then who are not only ſubjects and ſervants, but have obtained the prerogative to be accounted ſons and friends in our fathers houſe and family, ſhall not we I ſay rejoyce? The ſecond fruit which we reap from affliction, is, that hereby God multiplies his gifts and graces upon us, as it is written, <hi>Mygrace is ſufficient</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65665:5"/> 
                  <hi>for thee: for my power is made perfect in weakneſſe, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 9. Humility, Faith, Patience, Prudence, and Repentance, are augmented and increaſed in us by ſuffering perſecutions. For look as bodily exerciſe is an help to increaſe health, ſtrength, and heate in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; and catechiſing or poſing of children (to which we often call them) is the way whereby they grow in knowledge; even ſo the ſeverall tryals and troubles, through which God exerciſeth, and makes proofe of our faith, cauſe it to grow from a leſſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and degree thereof unto a greater.</p>
               <p>A Captaine, who hath once or twiſe beſieged a city or caſtle, becomes much more expert, hardy, and wary than a freſh water ſouldier; ſo alſo is the prudence, counſell, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, fortitude, and zeale much greater, and reſolution ſtronger, in ſuch as have often paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the pikes of tribulations, than theirs who never knew what ſuch tryalls meant. Yet I affirme not that perſecutions have alwaies this effect in all, who have but once burnt their fingers in this fire of afflictions; as if they ſhould not cauſe them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to grow cold, and forſake their ſtanding: for as concerning ſuch, their faith was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truly grounded in them, they have only had the outſide and ſhadow of Faith. Even as the ſeed ſowed upon the ſtones eaſily drieth away, for lack of good moiſture, and rooting, by the exceſſive heating of the Sun; ſo this formall profeſſor, with his painted ſhewes of Religion, and outward appearance of faith, when the heat of perſecution approcheth, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth away and comes to nothing.</p>
               <p>But where faith is livily rooted in the heart of the Beleever, and alwaies watered by the holy Ghoſt, although through ſtormes and tempeſts it may come to be ſhaken, yet doe the roots thereof grow more ſtrong and ſetled; as the root of a tree planted in a high place, which hath the winds ſtill beating upon it, is fortified, and growes daily by the ſap, which the other wants that is ſeated in a low and ſhady place. In a word, perſecution may be compared to fire, which hardens the clay, and melts the waxe, and conſumes the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: ſo it works divers effects, according as it meets with ſundry ſubjects; for either it addes courage to one ſtrong in faith, or elſe ſoftens ſuch as are yet weake, or in the end ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines ſuch as are Backſliders and Apoſtata's. So did the red Sea ſave the people of God, <note place="margin">Exo. 14. 22. 28.</note> who beleeved in him and his promiſes, and drowned <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt (being Infidels) in the bottome thereof as a ſtone.</p>
               <p>Now whereas I ſaid, That perſecutions doe cauſe unto us the multiplying of Gods ſpirituall gifts and graces, my meaning is not only concerning the ſpirituall, but even of temporall good things alſo: for howſoever the latter of theſe happens not ſo uſuall to the faithfull as the firſt, becauſe the Lord according to his wiſe diſpenſation (knowing mans nature to be altogether corrupted) would not occaſion ſuch, by enriching them, to forget him, and fixing their minds on things earthly, to make them their treaſure; yet hath it oft come to paſſe, that the Faithfull have been greatly enriched even by perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Among others, <hi>Abraham</hi> proſpered more in power and worldly ſubſtance amongſt <note place="margin">Gen. 13 2. 6.</note> Heathens and ſtrangers, than ever he had like to have done in his owne countrey. Alſo <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> in his Fathers houſe but a ſilly Shepheard, being baniſhed thence by the hatred <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 21. &amp; 41. 45.</note> and perſecutions of his Brethren, became the Governour of a whole kingdom, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 6. Did not <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo obtaine ſuch honours and dignities in Babylon among Idolaters, as <note place="margin">Dan. 2. 48. &amp; 5. 29.</note> he could never have expected to be raiſed to be raiſed to the like in the land of Iudaea? But to ſay no more of antient examples, I could alleadge many the like, and that of late yeares. But theſe formerly mentioned may ſuffice; but only this I thinke, that of all ſuch as have been perſecuted for the Truths ſake, there is not one (if he would ſpeake uprightly) but muſt acknowledge, that he was never unprovided for in his afflictions, nor left altogether without neceſſaries; God therby teaching him by experience, what care he had over him.</p>
               <p>Let not perſecution therefore too much daunt us, leſt we or our poſterity ſhould by means thereof fall into poverty. For as we read in the hiſtory of <hi>Iob,</hi> after the Sabeans and Chaldeans had ſtripped him of all that ever he had, yet God in the end reſtored to him more than he had loſt. Say then that our goods be confiſcated by Tyrants, let us not feare we ſhall be utterly impoveriſhed thereby; for it is the courſe which God takes in providing us of food and raiment, by way of rendring us us a reward when we have loſt our livelihood in his ſervice.</p>
               <p>Kings are uſually wont to recompence ſuch as have ventured the loſſe of their <note place="margin">Simile.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65665:5"/> and Livings in their quarrell. And do we not ſee many Italians baniſhed out of Naples and other parts, who have obtained great penſions in France? Shall we thinke then, that God hath leſſe love or reſpect of his, who ſhew themſelves forward to defend his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and honour? We may therefore aſſure our ſelves, that if we walke with a right foot in the way of Gods commandements, it is in a manner impoſſible for us to eſcape perſecution; but yet on the other ſide, wee ought much more to beleeve, that his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings ſhall never ceaſe to accompany us, and to reſtore unto us an hundred fold backe againe that which Tyrants either can or would ſnatch away from us, be it food or ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The third fruit which we may reap out of our afflictions is, That God uſeth them as <note place="margin">Afflictions ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ive in the church, as rods hanged up here and there in ſchooles.</note> his fatherly rods to correct the offences which we his children have and daily doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit againſt him: So as they are no leſſe needfull for a Church than rods in a ſchoole, or houſhold diſcipline in a well governed Family. For we cannot long perſiſt in the right way without them, our nature being ſo corrupt as it is; we ſhould grow to be diſordered, if we were not held in by perſecutions and afflictions. What ſhould become of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, if every one were left to do as him liſted? So if God ſhould forbeare to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his children, the city of God would in time come to be a Sodome, and the ſheepfold of Chriſt an Hog-ſtie or a Colledge of a Devils.</p>
               <p>A loving father, that puts forth his ſonne to be a ſcholler, intreats his Maſter now and <note place="margin">Simile.</note> then to correct him: And if through indulgency he neglects to doe it, the father will complaine of him that he marres his child. Would we be Schoolers in Chriſts School, and not ſuffer him to doe that to us, which we would a Schoolemaſter ſhould do to our children? So indeed, if we ſhall refuſe to beare the yoke in our youth, we may worthily be condemned with the world when we are old. It is good for a man, ſaith the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>That he beare the yoke in his youth;</hi> for ſuch is the untamedneſſe of our ſimple nature, <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 27.</note> that if it be not betimes curbed, &amp; continually kept ſhort, it will hardly be reclaimed or brought within compaſſe. But if God once take the rod into his hands, we begin then to have ſome feare of offending him; and if we doe, we are ready to confeſſe it. The rod wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the dead and drowſie conſcience: It makes us mourn and weep, as alſo to accuſe and condemne our ſelves for our ingratitude towards ſo good and gracious a Father; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to toſſe and roule our ſelves this way and that way to find eaſe, waiting from whence it will ſpring forth unto us.</p>
               <p>In this perturbation and anxiety of conſcience the holy ſpirit of God, ſeeing us caſt downe and humbled, ſets before our eies Gods mercy in Chriſt: Whoſe bloud applyed by faith purgeth and heales the wound which is made therein. This done, he will carry ſuch an hand over us as ſhall withhold us from vice, and draw us on to the love of vertue. And thus we ſee how the Lord doth by little and little correct our ſinnefull diſpoſition, by exerciſing us with manifold afflictions; whereby the whileſt hee provides for his owne glory. Let us therewith conſider his admirable bounty, ſeeing thus he covers our ſhame: for whereas he might juſtly cauſe us to ſuffer for our ſinnes which we have committed againſt his Majeſty, he in ſtead thereof turns it to ſuffering for his truth and holy names ſake; putting this honourable Title as a veile over us, to ſhadow our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</p>
               <p>For firſt he alters the nature of the puniſhment, which is due unto us for our miſdeeds, into an aſſured hope of recompenſing all our labour and travell we undergoe for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſes. And in the ſecond place, he turnes the diſhonour which we ought to receive, as a token of the vengeance which he might to our ignominy execute upon us, into an immortall Trophee of Honour, wherewith wee are crowned in the preſence of God and of his Angels. Thirdly, hereby he graciouſly provides for the peace of our conſciences, which, in ſtead of ſorrow and griefe wherewith they might be wounded for guilt of ſinne, on the contrary do ſenſibly rejoice and glory in theſe ſufferings for the name of Chriſt. And fourthly in the midſt of all theſe joyes, and moſt ſingular conſolations, yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (for all that) ceaſeth not to retain a ſcruple or dramme of Rubarb mingled here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, to purge out now and then ſome corrupt humors, and by perſecutions to put us in mind of our ſinnes committed againſt the Lord in times paſt.</p>
               <p>But yet he ſo tempers and moderates theſe his drugges, and that in ſo exquiſite and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall a manner, that while he humbleth us with his left hand, hee ſupporteth us with
<pb facs="tcp:65665:6"/> his right hand; if he cauſeth griefe, by and by he comforts us; in ſmiting he heals us; in which mixture and tempering of things, ſo much diffring in nature and quality, conſiſts the ſalvation of our ſoules. Even as the skilfull and expert Phyſitian, by meaſuring out an equall and juſt proportion of contrary drugs meeting with our corrupt humors, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for the ſafety of our bodies.</p>
               <p>We ſee that an hot or dry Summer, or a faire Spring time, brings many diſeaſes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; <note place="margin">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now to proceed to the fourth benefit of afflictions, which is to kill the pride of our <note place="margin">(4)</note> rebellious nature: The Hebrewes uſe theſe two words, to <hi>afflict</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> for one and the ſame thing; as if the latter were the fruit of the former. Nor doe we want examples which may ſufficiently admoniſh us, that as worldly proſperity uſually cauſeth our hearts to ſwell, and to be puffed up; ſo on the contrary, adverſities and afflictions deject and humble us. Whileſt <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> abounded in all his delights, his heart was <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 30. Dan 315.</note> ſwolne ſo farre with pride, that he began not only to oppreſſe his ſubjects, but to juſtle even againſt God himſelfe by his blaſphemies. But when God had once caſt him into the furnace of affliction, hee then became as meeke and humble a perſon as was in all his kingdome. <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 37: 2 Chr. 33. from verſe 1. to verſ 24.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manaſſes</hi> raigning in peace and liberty over the people of Iudah, grew ſo inſo lent, that there was no impiety or injuſtice wherein he overflowed not; but being ſurpriſed by his enemies, and laid in yron bands and fetters, he was changed in an inſtant, and became as low in his owne eſteeme as ever he thought himſelfe high: which appeareth in his prayer made to God in his affliction, wherein he proſtrates himſelfe before him, confeſſing his offences with great compunction of heart and humility.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bare himſelfe like a fierce and cruell Lyon all the while hee enjoyed favor <note place="margin">Acts 9. from verſe 1. to verſe 24.</note> from the high Prieſts, raging hither and thither, breaking forcibly into houſes, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending ſuch as he found to be profeſſors of the Goſpell; but the ſame man, being touched by Gods hand in the way as he was journying towards Damaſcus (intending there to exerciſe his Commiſſion upon the Saints and ſervants of Chriſt) ſuddenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came alſo as meeke as a Lambe, and was ready to proffer his ſervice in whatſoever the Lord would enjoyne him to doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in his Prologue to the eighth booke of his Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory, relates, how God ſeeing the pride which began to bud and ſpring forth in the Church, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally among the Paſtors thereof (who out of their ambition ſtrove about dignities and preferments therein) was moved for that very thing to raiſe up that great perſecution which befell the Church under the reigne of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximinian,</hi> to crack their pride, and to provoke them to prayer, yea rather to watch over their flocks, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend who ſhould be the greateſt.</p>
               <p>Wherein we may ſee, that by the bleſſing of God there is a kind of vertue in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to humble and bring thoſe home who through proſperity have forgotten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſtrayed out of the right way. Nay, ſo forcible are they to abate and take downe the pride of ſuch who otherwiſe are hardened and growne obſtinate, that even <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as <note place="margin">Exo. 8. 8. &amp; 9. 27. &amp; 10. 16.</note> rebellious and ſtiffe necked as he was, ſeemed ſomtimes to bend and bow under the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand of God. Whilſt God gave him ſome reſpite, it is true, he ſtill hardened his heart; but when the next judgement fell upon him and his people, he by and by became as pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as a glove for ones hand.</p>
               <p>Seeing then all of us naturally are thus inclined, to waxe proud by proſperity, a vice which God ſets and oppoſeth himſelfe againſt above other, as moſt abhominable in his ſight, we ought not me thinkes ſo much to be terrified at the approach of perſecutions, foraſmuch as they withhold from, and correct in us the ſame our pride, ſooner than all the inſtructions which are taught us by word of mouth.</p>
               <p>The next benefit afflictions bring us, is to quicken us up to the prayer of faith, which
<pb facs="tcp:65665:6"/> is never better diſcerned than when afflictions lie heavieſt upon us. <hi>In my diſtreſſe</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>Feried unto the Lord.</hi> For as our deſires to obtaine mercy grow ſtronger, ſo are <note place="margin">Pſal. 120. 1.</note> our requeſts more or leſſe ſervent; our deſire alway being according to our neceſſity. Let a man be ſicke, poore, or lie under any other greater tryall, the prayers of ſuch do beyond compariſon exceed in earneſtneſſe and ſervour theirs, who are well and at their hearts eaſe. <hi>David</hi> in many of his Pſalmes preſſed the Lord in ſuch wiſe by prayer, <note place="margin">Pſal. 17. 1, 2. &amp; 28. 1, 2.</note> when troubles lay heavy upon him, as if he meant to take no deniall.</p>
               <p>With what vehemency prayed the Apoſtles to God for ſtrength, being perſecuted <note place="margin">Act. 4. 5, 6. 24. 29.</note> by the Rulers, Elders, and Scribes of Ieruſalem, inſomuch as the place was ſhaken where they were aſſembled? He that ſhall duely weigh with what prayers and teares our Lord <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7. Luke 22. 44.</note> Ieſus Chriſt ſolicited his father in his paſſion, being nigh unto his death, will confeſſe that fire is not more apt to be kindled by the winds which blow upon it, than the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Faith is fired and augmented by affliction. Would any man have imagined that ever ſuch voices of prayers and prayſes ſhould have been made in the belly of a Whale, <note place="margin">Ionah 2. reade the whole chapter.</note> as <hi>Ionas</hi> made being there as it were in the bottome of hell?</p>

Could any man judge how beneficiall a fire were, if he were not ſome times pinched with cold? Or with what delight could we accept of drink in the hear of Summer, if we were not almoſt dried up with thirſt? Or how acceptable reſt is, if we were not tyred out with travell and labour? As we ſee then, that theſe accidents (how grievous or incommodious ſoever, now incident unto our nature corrupted by finne) doe notwithſtanding diſpoſe us to receive exceeding contentments therefrom: So perſecutions, albeit in and of themſelves naturally abhorred, proceeding partly (as we have ſaid) from Gods diſpleaſure, and partly from Satan and his inſtruments; yet doe they fit and prepare us for the injoying of thoſe great conſolations which God hath promiſed to his Elect. Afflictions cauſe us to feele, firſt, That God is the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and of all comfort: Secondly, That the Office of Chriſt his Sonne is, To revive the <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 1.</note> deſolate and broken in heart; Thirdly, That the holy Ghoſt is the comforter of his <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28. Iohn 14. 16: Rom. 15. 4.</note> Church: Fourthly, That the word of God is it that miniſters comfort to us in all our tribulations and adverſities which for the moſt part befall us for adhering thereto.</p>
               <p>For as he who would taſte meat favoury to his palate, uſeth falt therewith; ſo if wee would (to purpoſe) finde the Word of God taſtefull to us, commonly it is when wee are in affliction. When did the Apoſtles rejoyce more, than after they had taſted of the whip <note place="margin">Acts 5. 4.</note> for the name of Chriſt? When did Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> face appeare as if it had been the face of an Angell, but when he ſtood before the Councell at Ieruſalem to anſwer for his life? <note place="margin">Acts 6. 15.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65665:7"/> He that looked upon the three young men in the hot fiery furnace, ſaw them walking up <note place="margin">Dan. 3. 25.</note> and downe there, as in ſome pleaſant and delightfull medow or garden. Behold that anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who (as himſelfe records) being led from Syria to Rome, there to be devoured, accompanied by ſea and land with a band of ſouldiers (which he tearmes ten Leopards) wiſhed by the way as he went, that he were in the middeſt of thoſe beaſts which were ready to rent him in pieces, and that their appetites might be whetted to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch him quickly; fearing leſt it ſhould happen to him as to ſome other Martyrs, that the beaſts out of a kind of reverence and humanity would not dare to approch unto him; being ready, he ſaid, rather to provoke them to the fight, than that they ſhould ſuffer him ſo to eſcape. Pardon me, I pray you, ſaith he, for I know what is profitable for me: I now begin to be a Diſciple of Chriſt, I affect nothing this world affords? What is ſo deare to me as Chriſt? If it be not ſufficient for me to be torne with beaſts, let fires and all the tortures of men and Devils be prepared for me; let all my body be diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, my bones bruiſed to pieces, ſo that I may enjoy communion with my God, and come into the preſence of my Saviour. And when he heard the Lyons roaring, he ſaid, I am the Lords wheat, I muſt be ground with the teeth of wilde beaſts, that I may be found pure bread.</p>
               <p>May we not now conjecture by the wiſhes of this holy Biſhop, what ſweet delight hee <note place="margin">Simile.</note> found in himſelfe in approaching nigh unto his Martyrdome? As a Queen then, or great Lady takes no greater content than when ſhe perceives in her husband ſome apparent ſignes of his favor, eſpecially then when ſhe hath conceived ſome ſuſpition of alienating his affection from her, or it ſeems to be any way cooled or abated: So the faithfull ſoule, who loves the Lord entirely, deſires nothing more, nor taketh at any time more delight, than when ſhe feeles from her husband Chriſt love for love, but chiefly in the houre of temptation and tribulation, which oft times cauſeth our heads and hearts to be poſſeſſed with jealouſies and ſuſpitions that we are out of his favour. Let us conclude then, that ſeeing (in regard of the reaſons heretofore alleadged) perſecutions are ſo honourable, every way profitable and delectable to the true Chriſtian; What cauſe hath he either to be grieved or terrified when they befall him? Nay, he ought with the Apoſtles and Martyrs to triumph and rejoyce.</p>
               <p>To which purpoſe may fitly bee applyed that ſaying of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> to his children, when hee ſaw the great honors that the King of Perſia had conferred upon him by their exile, finding kinder entertainment among ſtrangers than in their owne countrey; We had periſhed, ſaid he, if we had not periſhed. So may we ſay, That did not our naturall life periſh here by perſecutions, we had never been ſaved in the kingdome of heaven.</p>
               <p>Run we then (my brethren) with patience the race that is ſet before us; let us not be aſhamed with <hi>Simon</hi> the Cyrenian to carry the reprochfull Croſſe of Chriſt; and ſeeing we muſt die once, let us deſire rather to die gloriouſly for righteouſneſſe ſake, than igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniouſly by ſhunning it. If Princes had rather die in a breach than in their bed; and to loſe their life in the field, than an eye at tilt or tourney; let us imitate them in this our ſpiritual conflict-earneſtly intreating the Lord, if it be his bleſſed will, that we may fight and die valiantly in the defence of his Truth, and for the honour of his ſonne. If worldly minded men can and will ſuffer many hard adventures, ſome for their honour, others for their profits and pleaſures, though but vaine and temporary; with what longing ſhould we aſpire to that certaine and eternall happineſſe, reſt, and glory, wherewith all thoſe ſhall be crowned who fight manfully and conſtantly for the cauſe of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>But the world and worldings ſmile at this wiſedome, counting it fooliſhneſſe; the fleſh alſo joyning therewith thinks all we have ſaid to be either idle phantaſies, or meere paradoxes; and no marvell, for both of them being from the earth can ſavour nothing but what is earthly, as Chriſt ſaith. Betweene the judgement of the Church and that of the World there is a broad difference, when the queſtion is of determining what is true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, profit, or pleaſure; whence it is that in a manner the one ſcornes that which the other admires and adores. So as they never conſent in approving or condemning with one voice that which is queſtioned; for the belly hath no eares. If therefore we meane to be ruled aright either in the matter of faith or outward manners, let us not bee guided therein either by the worlds judgement, or yet that of the fleſh; for the world is pore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinde, and the belly, as we have ſaid, hath no eares.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65665:7"/>

Be it that Satan and his confederates doe perſecute the Church of Chriſt, yet hath ſhe an aſſured hiding place. The faithfull may be impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but in the meane while they leave the world in a worſe priſon, <hi>viz.</hi> ſhut up under the wrath of God. They may be in bonds, yet is not that ſo bad as to lie bound in the bonds of iniquity; they are oft ſhut up in darke and unſavoury places, but how can darkneſſe be grievous to them who are the children of light, eſpecially when God ſhines upon them with the light of his countenance? Stinking holes and odious ſmels cannot ſo offend and annoy them, but that the ſweet ſavour of a good conſcience, purified by faith, ſurmounts all. They may be put into dungeons in the world, yet being choſen of God out of the world, they have their converſation in heaven. Be it that they loſe a few commodities here, it is but as if they forſook counters to receive gold, things terreſtriall for celeſtiall. A Chriſtian may ſuffer, but he cannot die; he may loſe his life, but hee cannot loſe Chriſt; when he leaves the world he goes to God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let us then put on the whole armour of God, and as good ſouldiers of <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 11. 2 Tim. 23. Rev. 2. 10,</note> Ieſus Chriſt enure our ſelves to endure hardneſſe. So ſhall it come to paſſe, that continuing faithfull in this ſpirituall Warfare unto the death, we ſhall at length receive the crowne of eternall life.</p>

            <p>For, for thrée yeares together the Goſpell was ſecretly taught among them, ſometime in houſes, then, in woods, in fields, and in caves of the earth, not without the ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What was among them preached, was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly practiſed: workes of mercy and charity were there exerciſed, not onely towards thoſe of the houſhold of Faith, but even towards them which were without; ſo as many by means here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> were drawn and brought on to the knowledge of Chriſt. They ordained in their aſſembly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Deacons to receive the almes which were given; men fearing God, being well approved of, who went wéekely from houſe to houſe to collect the abnes of ſuch as they knew to be faithful: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing every one how to carry themſelves themſelves in their vocations, and of their duty in contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting towards the reliefe of the poore Saints.</p>
            <p>And thus each one according to his place ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to expreſſe and manifeſt his faith by the fruits thereof, namely good works.</p>
            <p>In a very ſhort ſpace of time, the Lord by the Miniſtry of his Word (though preached in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret) erected here a flouriſhing Church, ſo as the Congregation conſiſted of a competent number of men, women, and children, not onely of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but out of foure or five Willages beſides bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering nigh unto it, who came alſo with an eager appetite to be inſtructed.</p>
            <p>In the meane while, you may conceive that ſatan and his adherents ceaſed not to ſtorm and rage hereat, not being able long to endure theſe their holy méetings; but when the time was now come, that God had given them power to prove and try his Church, they foreflowed not to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their cruelty upon if, which long before they had plotted and contrived.</p>
            <p>Upon Saturday then the ſixth of March, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1556. betwéene nine and ten of the Clocke in the night, the Provoſt of the City with his Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants armed themſelves to make ſearch, if they could finde any met together <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Being violently entred into the ſaid houſe, and ſéeking here and there for their prey, they found certaine bookes which they carried away. But he whom they principally aimed at was not then in the houſe; <hi>viz.</hi> Baudicon the ſonne of the ſaid Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dicon, thinking his brother miſtooke him for ſome other, ſaid, it is I, open the dore: with that, the ſergeants approching nigh unto it, opened the ſame, and cauſing him to enter in, ſaid, Ah Sir,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65665:9"/> you are well met, to whom he anſwered, I thank you my friends, you alſo are welcome hither.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Provoſt, I arreſt you all in the Emperors name, and with that commanded each of them to be bound, to wit, the husband &amp; his wife with their two ſons, leaving their two daughters to looke to the houſe. Now as they conveied them along through the ſtréets, Baudicon with a voice ſomewhat extended (which might eaſily be heard <note place="margin">The prayer which Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicon made as he was led to priſon.</note> at that time of the night) ſaid, O Lord, aſſiſt us by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> thy grace not onely to be priſoners for thy name ſake, but to confeſſe thy holy truth in all purity before men, ſo farre as to ſeale the ſame with our blouds for the edification of thy poore Church.</p>
            <p>Thus were they brought into ſeverall priſons, where they were ſeverally handled; yet ceaſed they not to praiſe and bleſſe the Lord with one conſent; within a few daies after, the priſoners were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before the Magiſtrates of the City, and examined as touching their courſe of life, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> their ſpéech firſt to Robert Oguier in theſe words: It is told us that you never come to maſſe, yea, and alſo diſſuade others from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thereto; wee are further informed that you maintain conventicles in your houſe, cauſing er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous doctrines to be preached there contrary to the ordinance of our holy Mother the Church, whereby you have tranſgreſſed the lawes of the Imperiall Maieſty.</p>
            <p>Robert Oguier anſwered, whereas firſt of all you lay to my charge that I goe not to Maſſe; I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> refuſe ſo to do, indéed, becauſe the death and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud of the ſonne of God, and his ſacrifice is utterly aboliſhed there, and troden under foot. <hi>For Chriſt by one ſacrifice hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>by</hi>

               <hi>one offering.</hi> For do we read in all the ſcriptures, that either the Prophets, Chriſt, or any of his Apoſtles ever ſaid maſſe? for they knew not what it meant. Chriſt indéed inſtituted the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in which all Chriſtian people doe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> together, but they ſacrificed not. If you pleaſe to read the Bible over, you ſhall never finde the Maſſe once mentioned therein. And therefore it is the méer invention of men. You know then what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>In vain do they worſhip me,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>As for the ſecond accuſation, I cannot nor will deny, but there have met together in my houſe honeſt people fearing God; I aſſure you not with intention to wrong or harme any, but rather for the advancement of Gods glory, and the good of many. I knew indéed that the Emperor had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it, but what then? I knew alſo that Chriſt in his Goſpell had commanded it. <hi>Where two or</hi>

               <hi>there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> Thus you ſée I could not well obey the Emperour, but I muſt diſobey Chriſt. In this caſe then, I chooſe rather to obey my God, then man.</p>
            <p>One of the Magiſtrates demanded what they did when they met together.</p>
            <p>To which Baudicon the eldeſt ſon of Robert Oguier anſwered; if it pleaſe you my Maſters to give mée leave, I will open the buſineſſe at large unto you.</p>
            <p>The Sheriffes ſéeing his promptnes, looking <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> one upon another ſaid, well, let us heare it then. Baudicon, lifting up his eies to heaven, began thus: when we méet together in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt to heare the word of God, we firſt of all proſtrate upon our knées before God, and in the humility of our Spirits doe make a confeſſion of our ſinnes before his divine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie. Then we pray that the word of God may be rightly divided, and purely preached: wee alſo pray for our Soveraigne Lord the Emperour, and for all his honourable Counſellors, that the Common-wealth may be peaceably governed to the glory of God; yea we forget not you whom we acknowledge our ſuperiors; intreating our good God for you, and for this whole City, that you may maintaine it in all tranquility. Thus I have ſummarily related unto you what we do: thinke you now, whether wée have offended ſo highly in this matter of our aſſemblies. Moreover if you will not be offended to heare the tenour of the prayers we make there, I am ready to recite the ſame unto you.</p>
            <p>One of the Magiſtrates gave him a ſigne by which hée might underſtand that they deſired to heare it. Baudicon then knéeling downe before them, prayed with ſuch fervency of affection, that the like ardency of zeale never appeared in him in ſo admirable a maner as at that time; Inſomuch that the Magiſtrates were forced to burſt forth into tears; beholding what a gratious Spirit the yong man was endued withall. Then ſtanding up, hée ſaid, now your Maſterſhips may take a ſcantling by this, how wée are imployed in our méetings.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they were thus examined, ech of them made an open confeſſion of the faith which they held. After this being returned againe into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they not long after were put to the torture, to make them confeſſe who they were that frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their houſe, but they would diſcover none, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſuch as were well knowne to the Iudges, or elſe were at that time abſent. About foure or five daies after, they were convented againe before their Iudges, namely, the father &amp; his two ſons: and after many words paſſed, they asked them whether they would ſubmit themſelves to the will of the Magiſtrates. Robert Oguier and Baudicon his ſonne, with ſome deliberation, ſaid, yes, we will.</p>
            <p>Then demanding the ſame of Mart. the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother, he anſwered, that he would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe thereto, but would accompany his Mother: ſo he was ſent backe againe to priſon, whileſt the father and the ſon were aduidged to be burned alive to aſhes. Now as they went to receive the ſentence, one of the Iudges ſitting in his place, after ſentence pronounced, ſaid, to day you ſhall go to divell with all the Devils in hell fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e (which he ſpake as one tranſported with fury in beholding the great patience of theſe two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt) for they tooke all things quietly, vanquiſhing their enemies cruelty by patient bearing the Croſſe, and in prayſing God for the ſame. Having received the ſentence of death, they were returned to the priſon whence they came, being ioyfull that the Lord did them that honor to be enrolled in the number of his Martyrs. No ſooner entred they the priſon, but a band of fryers came in thither: one amongſt the reſt told them, the houre was come in which they muſt finiſh their daies. Robert Oguier and his ſon anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, we know it well. But bleſſed be the Lord our God, who now delivering our bodies out of this vile priſon, will receive our ſoules into his glorious and heavenly kingdome.</p>
            <p>One of the Fryers whoſe name was Lazard, a notable limme of Antichriſt, endeavoured to turn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> them from their faith, ſaying, Father Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, thou art an old man, let mée intreat thée in this thy laſt houre to think of ſaving thine owne ſoule. And if thou wilt give eare to mée, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thée thou ſhalt do well.</p>
            <p>The old man anſwered, poore man, how dareſt thou attribute that to thy ſelfe which belongs to the eternall God, and ſo rob him of his honour;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65665:9"/> for it ſéemes by thy ſpéech, that if I will hearken to thée, thou wilt become my Saviour. No, no, I have one only Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, who by and by will deliver me from this miſerable world. I have one Doctor, whom the heavenly Father <note place="margin">

            <p>A Fryer, called the Father of Saint Clare, exhorting him to take pitty of his ſoule which Chriſt had redéemed: Thou willeſt me, ſaid Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> to pitty mine owne ſoule, doeſt thou not ſée what pitty I have on it, when for the name of Chriſt I wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ngly abandon this body of mine to the fire, hoping to day to be with him in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe? I have put all my confidence in God, and my hope wholly is fixed upon the merits of Chriſt his death and paſſion, he will direct me the right way to his Kingdome. I beléeve whatſoever the holy Prophets and Apoſtles have written, and in that faith will I live and die.</p>
            <p>The Fryer hearing this, ſaid, Out Dog, thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> art not worthy the name of a Chriſtian; thou and thy ſon with thée are both reſolved to damne your bodies and ſoules with all the devills in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of hell.</p>
            <p>As they were about to ſever Baudicon from his father, he ſaid, Let my father alone, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him not thus, he is an old man, and hath an infirme body, hinder him not I pray you, from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Crowne of Martyrdome.</p>
            <p>Another of the Fryers ſaid, Away varlet, thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> art the cauſe of thy fathers perdition. The Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers then turning themſelves towards the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, ſaid, On, on, Officer, doe thine Office, for we will be gone, we loſe but our labour, ſéeing the devill hath bewitched them.</p>
            <p>Baudicon was then conveyed into a chamber apart, and there being ſtripped of his clothes was fitted to be ſacrificed; now as one brought him Gunpowder to put to his breaſt, an odde fellow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſtanding by ſaid, Wert thou my brother, I would ſell all that I am worth to buy Fagots to burne thée, thou findeſt but too much favour. The yong man anſwered, Well Sir, the Lord ſhew you more mercy. Some that were preſent, ſaying, Good God, is it not a pittifull ſight to behold theſe poore men? A Doctor being by anſwered, And what pity would you have ſhewed towards them?

            <p>Whileſt they ſpake thus to Baudicon, ſome of the Fryers cloſed in with the old man, perſwading him at leaſt to take a Crucifixe into his hands, leſt the people (ſaid they) ſhould murmure againſt you; adding further, that he might for all that lift up his heart to God, becauſe you know, ſaid they, it is but a péece of wood.</p>
            <p>Thus they faſtened it betwéen his hands, but as ſoone as Baudicon was come downe, and eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> what they had done to his father, he ſaid, Alas father, what doe you now, will you play the Idolater even at your laſt houre. And then pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the idoll out of his hands which they had faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, he threw it away, ſaying, What cauſe hath the people to be offended at us, for not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Ieſus Chriſt of wood? We beare upon our hearts the Croſſe of Chriſt the Son of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living God, féeling his holy word written therein in Letters of Gold.</p>
            <p>As they were led to execution, a band of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> were attendant upon them, no leſſe then if a Prince had béen conducted into his kingdome. Béeing come to the place where they were to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, they aſcended up the ſcaffold which was there prepared for them. Then Baudicon asked leave of the Sheriffes to make a confeſſion of his faith before the people. Anſwer was made, That hée was to looke unto his ghoſtly Father and Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; confeſſe your ſelfe (ſaid they) to him. He was then haled rudely to the ſtake, where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſing the ſixtéenth Pſalme. The Fryer cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, Doe you not heare my Maſters, what wicked errours theſe hereticks ſing, to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ile the people withall. Baudicon hearing what he ſaid, replyed thus; Now ſimple idiot, calleſt thou the Pſalmes of the Prophet David, errors? But no marvell, for thus you are wont to blaſpeme againſt the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Then turning his eye towards his father, who was about to be chained to the ſtake, he ſaid, Be of good courage father, the worſt will be paſt by and by. As the executioner was faſtening him to the poſt, he chanced to hit him with his hammer on the foot, to make him ſtand néerer to the ſame. The old man being ſenſible of the blow, ſaid, Friend, thou hurteſt my foot, why doeſt thou abuſe me thus? The Frier hearing this, ſaid, Ah theſe heretickes! They would be counted Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs forſooth; but if they be but touched a little, they cry out as they were killed. To which Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicon thus replyed: Thinke you then that we feare the tormentors? No ſuch matter; for had we feared the ſame, we had never expoſed our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to this ſo ſhamefull and painfull a kinde of death.</p>
            <p>Then he often reiterated theſe ſhort breathings, O God, Father everlaſting, accept the ſacrifice of our bodies, for thy well beloved Sonne Ieſus Chriſts ſake. One of the Friers cried, Heretike, thou lieſt, he is none of thy father, the Devill is thy father. And thus, during theſe conflicts, he bent his eyes to heaven, and ſpeaking to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid; Behold, for I ſée the heavens open, and millions of Angels ready preſt to receive us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing to ſée us thus witneſſing the truth in the view of the World. Father, let us be glad and rejoyce, for the joyes of heaven are ſet open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid one of the Fryers, I ſée hell open, and millions of Devils preſent to carry you thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But the Lord, who never forſakes any that put their truſtin him, ſtirred up the heart and opened the mouth of a poore man who ſtood among the multitude, beholding this ſpectacle, who being moved with compaſſion, cryed aloud, Be of good comfort Baudicon, ſtand thou to it, thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>Fire was forthwith put to the ſtraw and wood which burnt beneath, whileſt they (not ſhrinking for the paines) ſpake one to another; Baudicon often repeating this in his fathers eares, Faint not father, nor be afraid, <hi>Yet a very little while and wee ſhall enter into the heavenly manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the end the fire growing hot upon them, the laſt words they were heard to pronounce, were <hi>Ieſus Chriſt thou Sonne of God, into thy hands we commend our ſpirits.</hi> And thus theſe two ſlept ſwéetly in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Within eight dayes after, Iane the mother, and Martin her ſonne were executed in the ſame City of Lile; but of this more hereafter.</p>

               <p>THe wife here followes her husband, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies her ſonne: her converſion is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable; for being ſevered from him, the Friers having ſeduced her laboured with her to turne her ſome alſo out of the right way; but he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding thereof recovers his mother againe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65665:10"/> and ſo they both gaue their lives for the truth, to the great confuſion of their enemies.</p>
               <p>But before we come to deſcribe their happy ends, we will, as briefely as may be, note by the way the great conflicts of ſpirit which both of them ſuſtained.</p>
               <p>There were ſent unto them many of the popiſh rabble, to turne them from their faith. Now that this their devilliſh enterpriſe might the rather be effected, they ſundred one of them from the other, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſo as by the politique deuice of a Monke, the poore woman began to waver, and let goe her firſt faith. At this their enemies rejoyced not a little, whileſt the poore little flocke of Chriſt, hearing ſuch ſad newes, were in continuall perplexity, but the Lord left them not in this mournfull condition.</p>
               <p>For on a day one of the Monkes reſorted to her in the priſon, counſelling her to win her ſonne Martin, and to draw him from his errors: which ſhe promiſed to doe. But when he was come to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> his Mother, and perceiued that ſhe was not onely fallen, but alſo quite turned out of the right way, he began with teares to bewayle her miſerable eſtate.</p>
               <p>O Mother, ſaith he, what have you done? Have you denyed him who hath redéemed you? Alas, what evill hath he done you, that you ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite him with this ſo great an iniury and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Now I am plunged into that woe, which I have moſt feared. Ah good God, that I ſhould live <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> to ſée this, which pierceth me to the very heart.</p>
               <p>His Mother hearing theſe his pittifull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and ſéeing the teares which her ſonne ſhed for her, began againe to renue her ſtrength in the Lord, and with teares cryed out, O Father of mercies, be mercifull unto me miſerable ſinner, and cover my tranſgreſſion under the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thy bleſſed Sonne; Lord enable me with ſtrength from above, to ſtand to my firſt confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make me to abide ſtedfaſt therein even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> my laſt breath.</p>
               <p>It was not long after this her change, but the ſame inſtruments of Satan, who had ſeduced her, came in, ſuppoſing to finde her in the ſame minde wherein they left her: whom ſhe no ſooner eſpied, but with deteſtation ſaid, <hi>Avoyd Satan. get thee behinde me: for henceforth thou haſt neither part nor portion in me.</hi> I will by the help of God ſtand to my firſt confeſſion; <hi>And if I may not ſigne it with Inke, I will ſeale it with my blood.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> And ſo from that time this fraile veſſell, who for a while relented, after her recovery grew ſtronger and ſtronger.</p>
               <p>The Iudges ſéeing their conſtancy, delayed not to diſpatch them out of the way, condemning them to be burned alive, and their bodies being reduced to aſhes, the ſame to be ſcattered and diſperſed in the aire. The mother and the ſonne having heard their ſentence read, in the way as they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backe againe to priſon, ſaid, now bleſſed be our God, who cauſeth us thus to triumph over <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> our enemies: <hi>This is the wiſhed houre, our glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome day is come.</hi> Let us not then, ſaid Martin, forget to be thankefull for the honour he doth us, in thus conforming us unto the Image of his Sonne. Let us remember thoſe who have traced this path before us: for this is the high way to the Kingdome of heaven. Let us then good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goe on boldly out of the Campe with the Son <note place="margin">

               <p>Some of the company hearing, but not being able to brooke theſe words, ſaid, we ſée now thou heretique that thou art wholly poſſeſſed body and ſoule with a divell, as was thy father and brother who are both in Hell. Martin ſaid, Sirs, as for your railings and curſings, our God will this day turne them into bleſſings in the ſight of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and of all his holy Angels.</p>

But you imagine to doe that which will never come to paſſe, though you pretend never ſo much that you are in the faith, and have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for you.</p>
               <p>The good woman hearing this, anſwered, Sir, Chriſt Ieſus our Lord ſaith, that it is the wide gate and broad way which leades to deſtruction, <note place="margin">

Doe ye then doubt whether we are in the ſtraight way or no, when ye behold our ſufferings? would you have a better ſigne then this, to know whether we are in the right way or no? Compare our Doctrine with that of your Prieſts and Monkes: we for our parts are determined to have but one Chriſt and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; we onely embrace the Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament. Are we deceived in belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that which the holy Prophets and Apoſtles have taught?</p>
               <p>One of the Fryers turning towards Martin, ſaid, youngman, be well adviſed; for thy father and thy brother have acknowledged the ſeven Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Church together with us: and thou poore ſilly youth haſt heard ſome wicked He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique who hath deluded thée: thinkeſt thou thy ſelfe wiſer then ſo many learned Doctors as have lived in ſo many ages? Martin anſwered, I pray you Sir, doth not Chriſt our Lord tell us, that his Father hath hid the ſecrets of his Kingdome from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed them to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. <hi>Iob</hi> 5. 13.</note> babes? And doth not the Lord oftentimes catch the wiſe in their owne craftineſſe?</p>
               <p>And whereas you ſay my Father and Brother have confeſſed ſeven Sacraments, I well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by this that I ought not to give credit to ought you ſay; knowye not that the Devill is the father of lies, and all liers? Is it not ſufficient that I acknowledge ſo many Sacraments as God himſelfe hath inſtituted and ordained, to wit, Baptiſme and the Supper of the Lord?</p>
               <p>Then came there into the priſon two men of great authority in the City of Liſle, the one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Mounſieur Barras, the other Beaufremes, who promiſed Martin great matters, if he would recant and returne to the Roman Church.

               <p>Martin gave him this anſwere. Sir, you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent before me many temporall commodities: but alas, doe you thinke me ſo ſimple, as to forſake an eternall Kingdome for enioying of a ſhort tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory life? No ſir, it is too late to ſpeake to me now of worldly commodities, but of thoſe ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which God hath prepared for me today in his Kingdome: nor doe I purpoſe to hearken after any other: onely, I pray you let me crave one houres reſpite to give my ſelfe to prayer, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the Name of my God: for you know now it is eight daies ſince my father departed this world, and hitherto I have ſcarce enioyed an hours reſt; That which I have had, hath rather béen to ſlumber in, then have any quiet ſléepe, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually had eight or nine perſons invironing me about, and talking unto me.</p>
               <p>After theſe great men were forced to goe even
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65665:10"/> as they came, Martin declared the effect of this his combat to certaine Brethren who were there detained with him in priſon; ſaying moreover, Let us lift up our heads Brethren, the brunt is over, this I hope is their laſt aſſault; forget not, I pray you, the holy doctrine of the Goſpell, nor thoſe good leſſons which you have learned from our Brother Guy. <note place="margin">It is very likely hee meanes Guy de Brez a godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, of whom you ſhall read more, God willing, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</note> Manifeſt it now to all, that you have received them not only into your eares, but alſo into your hearts; follow me, we leade <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> you the way; feare not, God will never leave nor forſake you: farewell Brethren, ſaid he, and ſo departed from them.</p>
               <p>Soone after Martin and his mother were bound and brought to the place of their Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: His mother having aſcended the ſcaffold, cryed to Martin, Come up, Come up my ſonne. And as he was ſpeaking to the people, ſhe ſaid, Speake out Martin, ſaith ſhe, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to all, that we die not Heretiques. Martin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> would have made a confeſſion of his faith, but could not be ſuffered. His mother being bound to the ſtake, ſpake in the hearing of the Spectators, We are Chriſtians, and that which we now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer is not for murther or theft, but becauſe we will beléeve no more than that which the Word of God teacheth us: Both reioycing that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for the ſame.</p>
               <p>The fire being kindled, the vehemency thereof did nothing coole or abate the fervency of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> zeale, but they continued conſtant in the faith, and with lifting up their hands to heaven, in an holy accord ſaid, <hi>Lord Ieſus into thy hands we</hi>

None néed to enquire whether the reſt were ſuffered to live in peace; for what other ſpectacles were to be eſpied in the high waies and fields, but poore fugitives flying hither and thither, for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> of their lives. So great was the cruelty which was then and there exerciſed among them: and yet, when all is done, God will be glorified in his Saints and children.</p>

The ſame day taking his text out of the eight of Saint Iohns Goſpel concerning the woman taken in adultery being brought to Ieſus Ch: he vttered execrable things againſt the Magiſtrate: ſhewing that it was no wonder if the Iudges did not caſt the firſt ſtone at the Lutherans, becauſe they themſelues were alſo Lutherans; and therefore the people were not to attend them any longer, but to riſe &amp; make open war againſt them, yea, upon the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them, which were but ſuſpected to hold that doctrine. In this garboile a poore Prieſt (with a brother of his, a Captain, paſſing by, and thinking by faire language to pacifie the diſordered tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult) had his foot no ſooner out of the Church dore, but he was ſet upon by this blood-thirſty crue, who although he asked forgiueneſſe in the name of the Saints, deſiring to be confeſſed, and <note place="margin">And thus thinking to martyr the Chriſtians, by the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, it fell on thoſe of their owne ſide.</note> ſhewed all outward ſignes of being one of their owne ſide, yet could he of this headleſſe beaſt the multitude obtaine no fauour, but was ſtabbed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the belly with a dagger, and fell downe dead.

               <p>THe court of the parliament of Paris, willing to moderate the cruelties uſed againſt thoſe of the reformed religion, ſollicited them what they could, to diſſemble and to yéeld in ſome points; wherein the well minded of that ſide were not yet rightly informed: but to this their aduice they would by no meanes conſent. Then they tooke another courſe, and that was ſimply to examine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> them touching the manner of eating Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the Sacrament, without mentioning Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, or any carnall preſence; hoping this way to frée them from the crime of ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, upon which point for the moſt part the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death was pronounced: ſéeing they had heard formerly from the priſoners, That the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of France held, how the body of Chriſt was receiued by the faithfull not in imagination, but truly and indéed, and that the ſignes were neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> naked nor empty elements, but exhibited that whereof they were ſignes.</p>
               <p>This was propounded to foure yong men who were in the flowre of their age, and lying priſoners in the Conſciergerie of the palace, if it might be, to ſatisfie them. Now when this confeſſion was preſented to the Court, all that were well affected were glad of it, in regard it was drawne ſo favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably; ſome being of opinion that it would work their deliverance. Others there were which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this proiect, and requeſted they might be examined what they thought of the Maſſe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo neceſſarie an article; provided, that there might be ſome moderation in the ordinary courſe of ſuch interrogations. Notwithſtanding it was thought, that this would rather hinder than fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their deliverance; yet did the better part per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their purpoſe of fréeing them.</p>
               <p>Being therefore asked again what they thought of the Maſſe, they anſwered, that they would ſtand to their firſt confeſſion. It was replyed, That the Court would reſt ſatisfied with that anſwer, if ſo be they would now only go to Maſſe. But with one voice they affirmed, that they would never yéeld to come there where God was ſo diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The Court, to make it appeare that no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ſhould be taken againſt them for this their anſwer, gave them leave ſeverally to ſhew their reaſons. This pleaſed the priſoners well, and therefore they ſpared not to paint forth the Maſſe in its lively colours; that all might perceive there was cauſe ſufficient why they ſhould deteſt it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, one of them by way of oppoſition ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">The Maſſe deciphered in its colours.</note> how contrary the Maſſe was to the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The ſecond declared, it was blaſphemy to affirme, that there was any other propitiatory ſacrifice for ſinnes then the blood of Chriſt. The third avouched, that if the article of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation (whereon the Maſſe depends) were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, Chriſt his deity and his humanity ſhould be aboliſhed, and therefore it muſt be flat idolatry to worſhip Almighty God in a corruptible péece of paſte. The fourth told them, that the fruits of the Sacramant could not be received where the Word was not joyned with the ſigne, where one of the ſignes were withheld, or where there was no Communion.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Maſſe anatomiſed, with the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations thereof, with all boldneſſe; ſo as ſome of the Iudges were conſtrained to averre openly, that there was a great abuſe in it indéed, being a manifeſt wrong done to the inſtitution of Chriſt; as alſo that the Laity were there depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Cup, and the Bread only given, the whole being performed in a language which the poore people underſtood not.</p>
               <p>It was beyond the expectation of all men, that ſo frée a confeſſion would have paſſed for currant in that place, in which whoſoever came before them formerly, and made the like, was condemned to die. But now the Truth ſo prevailed, that againſt all hope and ordinary procéedings in times paſt, yea, contrary to the mindes of thoſe which were Gods chiefeſt enemies, the order was this, That howſoever ſentence of death had béen pronounced againſt thrée others of this company, by the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour judges, yet theſe foure ſhould have their lives ſaved; provided, that they departed the countrey <note place="margin">Foure wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the truth gently entreated by their Iudges.</note> within fiftéene daies. Which exception, though it favoured of ſome injuſtice, yet was it nothing in compariſon of the former cruelties; and this ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment turned rather for a benefit to them than an hurt, for by this meanes they had liberty to go to ſuch places where God was purely ſerved.</p>

               <p>AMong the reſt there was a Counſellor called <hi>Anne du Burg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> a man of ſingular underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and knowledge, bred and nurſed up in the boſome of the Church of Chriſt. This man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> rendred thankes to God, for mooving the Kings heart to be preſent at the deciſion of ſo waighty a cauſe as that of religion is, and having exhorted him well to conſider thereof, being the cauſe of Chriſt himſelfe, which of good right ought to be maintained by Princes, ſpake boldly therto, as God gave him utterance; It is not, ſaith he, a matter of ſmall conſequence, to condemne ſuch as in the middeſt of the fiery flames call upon the name of Ieſus Chriſt. This I doe but note here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> by the way, becauſe the conſequence is touched before by Maſter Iohn Foxe, where he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the terrible end of ſuch as were perſecutors of the truth.</p>
               <p>Only one thing more touching the ſaid Anne du Burg I could not here omit, and it is this. A certaine woman being priſoner (for the ſame cauſe) right over againſt him, had a little window in her chamber which opened towards that where <note place="margin">In the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs mention is made of one Peter Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deau, whoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy was ſo admirable in ſuffering the extremity of death, that it was the meanes to imbolden this worthy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor Anne Du Burg with others to ſuffer for the cauſe of the Goſpell.</note> Maſter du Burg lay; from whence either by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> words or ſignes (when ſhe was not otherwiſe letted) ſhe encouraged him to perſevere conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the truth; by whom he was ſo comforted, that the ſame du Burg, being importuned by ſome of his friends to recant, uſed theſe words, nay, I trow not, ſaid he, for a woman hath taught me my leſſon, how I ought to carry my ſelfe in this buſineſſe to which God hath called me, fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in himſelfe as it ſéemed the force and power of the godly admonitions of this poore woman.</p>
               <p>Whoſe godly zeale was ſuch, as that her ſtory <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> may not (as I thinke) be well omitted, but fully ſet downe as I finde it recorded in the volume of the French Martyrs. Her name was Margaret Rich, who ſuffered the ninetéenth of Auguſt in the place called Maubert, not far from the City of Paris in France.</p>
               <p>Chriſtian women, ſaith the Hiſtorian, behold here the courage and zeale of this Margaret your ſiſter, who is ſet before you for a patterne to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate: ſhe encouraged both great and ſmall, who at that ſame time were priſoners with her.</p>
               <p>Margaret Rich was born in Paris, the Wife of Anthony Ricant Bookſeller, dwelling in Paris in the place called the Mount of Saint Hillary, at the ſigne of the great Quaile. This woman was as vertuouſly diſpoſed as could be; ſhée had gotten ſome ſmall inſight into the myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, by meanes of her husband, who yet ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to obſerve the ſuperſtitions of Popery, without urging her any further; for he was a man indifferent in the matter of Gods ſervice: but yet her conſcience gave her, that knowing her courſe to be evill, it was not ſufficient to forſake that, unleſſe ſhée did cleave to the contrary good which leads to life and ſalvation, namely to ſerve God according to his Word. Vnderſtanding then, that there were godly méetings of good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which aſſembled together in the City, ſhée found the meanes to come in amongſt them, and profited ſo well thereby, that ſhe reſolved in her ſelf never to goe again to the Maſſe, but to die rather.</p>
               <p>At length being hardly uſed by her husband becauſe of this her ſudden change, hée threatned her ſo far as to carry her himſelfe to the Maſſe, (the next day which was Eaſter-Sunday) rather than that ſhée ſhould not goe. After ſhée had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured much from this man who would have her to play the diſſembler, ſhée to preſerve her ſelfe therefrom, being alſo afraid of her husbands fury, upon Eaſter day withdrew her ſelfe to a friends houſe of hers: thinking it ſafer to diſpleaſe her husband, than God, to whom ſhée had dedicated her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>This day being paſt, becauſe ſhée would not over-long abſent her ſelfe from her owne home, ſhée determined to returne back againe to him, whom God had bound and conjoyned her with, though ſhée could not but foreſée the great evills and inconveniences which would follow thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in regard of her ſaid husbands crooked diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Shée came no ſooner home, but ſhée was diſcovered by the Curate of Saint Hillary, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted priſoner, &amp; brought into the <hi>Conſciergery.</hi> They asked her where ſhe had kept her Eaſter: ſhe without faining told them, ſhe abſented herſelf from home, that ſhe might abide a while with ſome of her loving friends, leſt ſhée ſhould be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to prophane the ſupper of the Lord, as others uſually did; and therefore had kept the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods ordinance, in the aſſembly of faithfull &amp; devout chriſtians. Being asked whether indéed ſhée had béen preſent at thoſe ſecret méet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: ſhée anſwered yea, and eſtéemed her ſelfe happy that ever ſhée came among them. And thus being queſtioned by the Counſell, with other priſoners, about the Maſſe, purgatory, auricular confeſſion, and ſuch other points, ſhée fréely told them what ſhée had learned concerning the ſame out of Gods word; ſo as the fifth of May ſhe was ordered to be ſent to the Biſhop, or his officiall, to ſée if by any meanes ſhe might be reclaimed. But the officiall prevailing nothing with her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe perſiſted conſtant in the profeſſion of the truth, he pronounced ſentence againſt her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring her to be a pertinacious and obſtinate he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique; yea ſuch a one as was to be redelivered over to the ſecular power, and thence to be ſent back to the Conſciergery.</p>
               <p>Being brought back into the Court, certaine Doctors and others were ſent to reaſon with her: yet her faith for all that ſtaggered not, but remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned victorious, notwithſtanding all their batteries laid againſt it,</p>
               <p>Then by the ſentence of the Court ſhée was condemned to be carried in a dung cart to the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65665:13"/> place called Maubert, a gagge to be put into her mouth, and there to be burned and conſumed to aſhes. But before ſhe ſhould ſuffer death, ſhe was ſentenced to be put to the extraordinary torture, to make her confeſſe, whom ſhe knew, and was converſant withall, and to name the houſe where ſhée received the Communion: yet did this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man undergo all theſe her afflictions, with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible joy, ſinging Pſalmes, and praiſing God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually: ſhe was never ſéen to ſhrinke at her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> impriſonment, ſhe daily exhorted the women who were priſoners with her, &amp; comforted them. Such of the Martyrs as went from the Conſciergery to ſuffer death, paſſed by the chamber where ſhée lay, yet was ſhe not diſheartened to ſée them in the hands of their executioners, but cryed to them, exhorting them to rejoyce, and with patience to beare the reproach of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the manner of her death; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſentence ſhée was led to the Chappell, as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> manner is; yet ſhée ceaſed not all the way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the people, and to ſing Pſalmes, till ſhe was put into a Dung-cart to be conveyed to the place of execution. The renowne of her conſtancy was ſo famous from the beginning of her troubles, that no ſmall multitude of people were gathered together in the ſtréets, for the deſire they had to behold her: God ſo appointing that the great and more than ordinary graces of his ſpirit (which were in this woman) might be manifeſted before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſo great a confluence of ſpectators, and eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. She paſſed on then, as it were trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing, through the middeſt of this aſſembly, not ſhewing any ſigne of the feare of death, but with a freſh colour and chéerefull countenance paſſed on with her eyes lifted up to heaven, nor did her gagge ſo disfigure her, but that ſhe ſhewed an amiable aſpect upon all that viewed her. So as even the rude and obſtinate multitude admired her; ſaying one to another, Doe you not ſée how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> this heretike ſmiles and laughes?</p>
               <p>Comming to the place of her martyrdome, they told her if ſhée would relent, ſhée ſhould be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled. She anſwered, That her reſolution was ſo rightly founded upon the word of God, that ſhée never meant to change. And to let them ſée that death terrified her not, ſhée began to diſrobe her ſelfe without troubling the hangman at all. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hoiſed up in the ayre, they asked her againe, if ſhée would not accept of the grace which the court <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> offered her, to be ſtrangled? She gave them a ſigne, that ſhée would not. Then was the fire kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, and ſo ſhée yéelded up her ſoul into the hands of God.</p>

               <p>DV Burg, being asked if he had conferred with any about certaine articles formerly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, anſwered, <hi>That he had conferred with his bookes, but eſpecially the holy Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having framed a Confeſſion of his faith which he intended to have preſented to the court of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, certain counſellors which were advocats in the ſaid Court pretending friendſhip towards him, being yet but time-ſervers, ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo diſcontented therewith, laboured with him to make another Confeſſion, not directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the truth, but ſomewhat ambiguous and doubtfull, ſo as it might give ſatisfaction to his Iudges.

But when the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly had got a true copy thereof, they were greatly gréeved, being more carefull of the ſaving his ſoule, of Gods glory, and the edification of his Church, then of ſuch a deliverance, which could not be obtained without great diſhonour to God.</p>
               <p>And therefore they gave order to M.

Amongſt the reſt he ſent to the city of Trent (ſo much renounced among Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in regard of the laſt Councell the Pope had there) for an excellent carber and maſter Builder called Iohn, a man very religious, and a lover of the Truth: for which cauſe the ſaid Iohn refuſed at the firſt to goe thither, alledging for himſelfe that he was of a contrary religion to that which the Conſull profeſſed, and therefore could not ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabit among ſuch as would obſerve his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Maſſe and their other ceremonies.

Don Iohn Ponce of Leon, the ſonne of Roderic Ponce of Leon Count of Baylen, may of good right deſerve to be placed in the firſt ranke. For beſides the noble race from whench he ſprang, the Lord had indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with ſingular vertues well beſéeming ſo worthy and Chriſtian a Gentleman. Thoſe who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> were of his familiar acquaintance, and did well obſerve his converſation, gave this teſtimony of his ſincerity, that his like was not knowne in Spaine of a long time, in that a man of his eſtate was ſo forward to exerciſe his charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch in whom he ſaw but any good incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to religion: yea, his yearely revenues, which were alſo great, were not onely imployed, that way, but he ſéemed to excéede the chiefeſt of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> his ranke, in yéelding his helpe and aide towards the reliefe of the poore. All which the world taking knowledge of, attributed (as it is woont) that which procéeded from his ſo Chriſtian bounty, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto waſtfulneſſe and prodigality.</p>
               <p>The Inquiſitors of Sevill envying the ſwéete ſavour of ſuch a life and converſation as he led be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, flowing from an inward taſte of true Religion, ſpared him no more than thoſe of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner condition. For having gotten him into their hands, they left no meanes unaſſayed, but uſed the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> utmoſt of their devices to weaken his faith. The truth is, that at the firſt this noble perſonage was much perplexed, but at the laſt the Lord fortified him ſo with his grace, that he was ſet in the firſt rounde of the guilty. Concerning his ſentence (howſoever this holy tribunall mixed the ſame with many untruths to bleare the eyes of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant withall) yet may it eaſily be collected out of the tenor of his ſentence, what he confeſſed and profeſſed. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> 
               </p>
               <p>For in the ſaid ſentence were read his articles for which he was principally condemned to the fire; namely, That hée abhorred the Idolatry which is committed in adoring the Sacrament, calling it a breaden god. Alſo, that when he met it as it was carried through the ſtréets, either in ſolemnity or to ſome ſicke body, he paſſed into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſtréet going apace before it, that he might give no reverence unto it. That comming often into the Cathedrall Church where maſſe was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> ſaid, he turned his back towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prieſt, becauſe he would not ſée him elevate his God. That hée uſed much to walke to and fro about the ſcaffold where the faithfull were executed, with a kinde of delight, coveting to ſtand neere unto them, that by accuſtoming himſelfe in beholding the place, and torments he ſaw others indure, he might bee the better emboldened to ſuffer the like when God ſhould call him thereunto.</p>
               <p>Theſe were in effect the Articles which were inſerted in his ſentence, a part whereof alſo was drawne out of the confeſſion of his faith, the ſum being this: Firſt. That a man is juſtified and accepted of God onely for the merrit of Ieſus Chriſt apprehended by faith. That the popes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and indulgences ſent from Rome are méere deluſions, and that the Pope is Antichriſt, &amp;c. That it was the deſire of his heart to be burned, or to ſuffer ſome other extremity for the maintenance of the Faith which he profeſſed. That he endevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to imploy the goods and riches wherwith God had bleſſed him, only for the defence and further inlarging of the doctrine of the Goſpel; Yea, to forſake life, wife, children, and all, for the ſame: to which end hee had daily ſent up many hearty prayers to God.</p>
               <p>In all this buſines, the holy tribunall labored by cunning devices to obſcure this confeſſion, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to be bruited that he held not out to the end, with many other like inventions to make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beleeve they had turned him to their Law: but herein they ſhewed themſelves not well adviſed, in that they belied both him and themſelves. For in publiſhing his crimes and offences with the manner of his death, what did they elſe but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and manifeſt the truth of the fact, which plainly appeareth in theſe words of the ſentence; Iohn Ponce of Leon, burned for an heretike and an obſtinate Lutheran, &amp;c.

               <p>GOnzalve a renowned Preacher throughout the Countrey of Andalouſie, was alſo led in this inquiſitoriall triumph: who forſaking his Schoole Divinity, in which learning he excelled all his fellowes, gave himſelfe wholly to the ſtudy of the holy Scriptures, according to the purity whereof his whole converſation was ordered, both inwarly and outwardly. Hee was often obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all his Sermons to ayme at this marke, namely to deliver mens minds from that blind conceit of meriting by works; that ſo way might be made for juſtification onely by Faith in Chriſt Ieſus, and déeply to in graft into them the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſole merit of his plenary ſatisfaction.

Now howſoever they were all endued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> with ſingular piety and godlineſſe, yet the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them named Bohorques, being under the age of one and twenty, was inſtructed above the reſt in holy letters, &amp; by dayly reading and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with good and godly men, wherewith Sevil at that time was well furniſhed, ſhée had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch promptneſſe in the knowledge of the Texts of the old and new Teſtament, that many who were eſtéemed learned in that City, have confeſſed they were often put to a non-plus by ſuch reaſons as ſhée alledged out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>As touching the firſt of theſe, Vaenia; her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> houſe was a ſchoole or colledge of piety, being the place alſo where all the méetings were, to publiſh the praiſes of God. No evill example was to bée ſéene there, nor ought that ſavoured of feigned hineſſe, but ſuch as procéeded from uprightneſſe of heart and ſincerity. But the Inquiſitors, who alwayes lye in waite to take hold, though but with the leaſt thréed of their net, caught theſe foure women with other their neighbours, in the ſame, when God knew they were fitted for the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his holy truth. Now as the Latine tongue did much aide the ſaid Mary Bohorques to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine her in reading of the holy Bible, whileſt the Popes Tyranny forbad the ſame to be read in the vulgar tongue; ſo ſhe came quickly to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with the more adverſaries during her captivity.

               </p>
               <p>During her Captivity there came many Monkes to diſpute and reaſon with her; above all, thoſe of the order of Saint Dominicke, who were enforced to admire the ſpirit of wiſdome, wherewith this Damoſell was inſpired, as alſo at the pregnant anſwers which ſhe gave to their demands. Shée ſuffered ſo many kindes of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that by the violence thereof they forced her to nominate her ſiſter Iane Bohorques, and to confeſſe that ſhe had often béen preſent at the Preaching of the Goſpell. This Iane was the wife of one called Francis Varquis, Lord of Higueras, a man of excellent note. Shée was ſixe Moneths gone with child when ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to priſon, and therefore was not ſo ſtraitly uſed, nor hardly dealt with all as other of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners were.

In which her extremity ſhée had comfort of none, but of a vertuous young maiden, who afterwards was burned for the profeſſion of the truth: which maid being one day brought by the Inquiſitors to the torture, was in a manner diſmembred, and then layd upon a bed of ſtraw, whereon both were laid in the priſon, ſerving rather to vexe then any way to eaſe them, yet did the other yeeld her all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe which her ſelfe or the place could poſſibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. Scarſe had this poore Damoſell recovered ſome eaſe after theſe intolerable bruiſes, but this aforeſaid Iane Bohorques taſted of the ſame bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cup, where ſhée was ſo cruelly tormented on the <hi>Burro,</hi> as they call it, which is a bench or forme whereon they give the Towell or Napkin, that the cords pierced through the fleſh into the bones, both of her armes and leggs: and in this pitifull plight the bloud guſhing out, ſhée was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to her priſon, where within eight daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it pleaſed God to frée her out of the clutches of theſe bloudthirſty, into his eternall happineſſe and glory.

At which time being moved with godly zeale, rather then being counſelled thereto, he undertooke a buſineſſe, which as it was of great importance, ſo of no ſmall perill and imminent danger; for he brought with him thence and cauſed a great number of Bookes of the holy Scriptures in Spaniſh to be conveied into Spaine, earneſtly thirſting after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and growth of the light of the Goſpell in his native countrey; which godly enterprize of his the Lord ſo guided, that he brought the ſame to a proſperous Iſſue; Yea, which is yet the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, even within the walles of Sevill, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinh all the watch and ward the Officers of the Inquiſition uſed.</p>
               <p>Theſe books to the poore Chrſtians there were welcommed with no leſſe joyfulneſſe, then the rain when it ſhowers downe upon the parched ground. For the Goſpell by meanes hereof grew, and was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>

But the newes hereof comming to the eares of the holy Fathers, firſt, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion and foole-hardineſſe of one more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous then wiſe, and then by the treachery of wily ſpies of the Inquiſition, who counterfeited a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpell, meerely to enſnare and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the ſincere profeſſors thereof, by their diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all practiſes: no ſooner had theſe venerable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or hunters rather gotten a ſent of this game <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> where it lay, but comming violently upon them, tooke the damme with her young ones. By which <note place="margin">Deut. 21. 6.</note> great ſurpriſall the whole flocke was ſcattered; but ſo many was the number of them even at their firſt apprehenſion, that it amaſed the huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men themſelves.</p>
               <p>For the priſons were ſo repleniſhed, that they <note place="margin">See what great increaſe God can bring out of weake beiginnings.</note> were faine to borrow private houſes to ſhut up the priſoners in. At once they burned twenty and upwards of them together, whilſt in Sevill they detayned in bonds 800. Amongſt whom this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> Iulian was one of the firſt which they met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, whom they kept in priſon above thrée yéeres laden with Irons: during which time, every day afforded new ſpectacles of catching their prey. But ſuch was his wonderfull conſtancy, that he wearied his tormentors from vexing him any more; ſo as new forces never failed this little leane body, to ſuffer any tortors the Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could deviſe. He was naturally of a chéere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> ſpirit, and God ſo increaſed the ſame in him, that he came from the torture with no leſſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage then when he was wont to come unto it: ſo as neither paine of the racke, nor the threats of the Officers, nor yet the cruelties they exerciſed upon him could withhold him from manifeſting to his priſon fellowes, as he went along by them, his conqueſt and victory, to the ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his adverſaries, uſing to ſay in Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh; <note place="margin">Such honor have all Gods Saints.</note> Theſe hypocrites are gone away confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, no leſſe then Wolves which have béene long <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> hunted.</p>
               <p>After many fierce encounters and ſharpe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes with the Monkes and others of the popiſh crew, being brought out of the priſon into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, there to receive the mark and livery of Chriſt the ſonne of God, with the reſt of the priſoners, it was reported, that he with a bold courage and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led countenance thus ſpake unto them; <hi>Courage my valiant and conſtant Brethren, now is the houre come in which, as the true Champions of Ieſus Chriſt, we muſt witneſſe his truth before men, and for a ſhort triall for his ſake wee ſhall triumph with him for ever and ever.</hi> But the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Inquiſion interrupted him inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by putting a gagge in his mouth, with which he continued untill a little before he dyed. Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting then upon the ſcaffold where he was to ſuffer, by manifold ſignes he ſhewed the conſtancy and ſtedfaſtneſſe of his faith, which by words he could not. For in aſcending up the ſteps of the ſcaffold, <note place="margin">When the Martyrs were hindred to manifeſt their faith by ſpeech, yet they would by outward geſtures do it as well as they could.</note> knéeling downe he kiſſed them; and being faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the ſtake, invironed and compaſſed round abut with fagots, he ſundry times bowed his head within the pile of wood, as if he deſired to die by fire, and ſo rendred up his ſoule into the hands of God, to the great admiration of the Spectators, and the animating of his fellow Martyrs who were to ſuffer with him. When he was to die, a certaine Doctor called Ferdinando Rodrigo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his intention, made the faith of this our little Iulian much more glorious: for he thinking by terrifying him with the apprehenſion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent torment he was to endure, obtained ſo much favour of the Sheriffe, as to permit him to ſpeake; thinking thereby to give the people ſome intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his recantation; which is the utmoſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph that theſe holy Fathers of the Inquiſition thirſt after: but it proved cleane contrary: for Iulian recovering liberty of ſpéech, did yéeld a more cléere evidence and demonſtration of his faith than formerly he had done, and ſo confuted this Doctor Rodrigo, (calling him a ſeducer, and one that ſpake againſt his conſcience) that by and by in an outrage, to cover his ſhame, he cryed out like a Bedlam; Muſt Spaine, which commands ſilence to ſo many, be thus troubled now with this ſo contemptible a wretch? Kill him, diſpatch him, &amp;c, At which words, the tormentors being there at a becke, forthwith kindled the fire upon him.</p>
               <p>¶ Now having thus formerly mentioned what tortures are exerciſed upon the bodies of Gods Saints by the mercileſſe Inquiſitors of Spaine, and that alſo upon thoſe of their owne Nation: it ſhall not be much from the purpoſe if from thence we take occaſion more particularly here to relate unto thée (Chriſtian Reader) with what inhumanity ſuch are uſed who for the cauſe of religion fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l into the hands of theſe carnall ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, according as I finde the ſame ſet forth at large by my Author, whoſe footſteps in the whole Work I endeavour to follow.</p>
               <p>WHen they purpoſe to torture any one, the Iaylor is commanded to bring forth his priſoner into the accuſtomed place where it is to be given; which place is under the earth, and very obſcure. Then going thorow many turnings, and thorow ſundry dores, ſo as the horrible cryes of thoſe who are there tortured can in no wiſe be heard, there is a ſeat prepared for the Iuquiſitors on high, with a Regiſter alſo to behold that tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call act. The torches being lighted, thoſe who are to act their parts in this wofull Tragedy are brought in: the tormentor who attends their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, is covered all over with a blacke garment, cloſe to his body, and on his head a blacke Hood, which hides his face from being ſéene; having on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two or thrée holes made therein for himſelfe to ſée and breathe at; and all this is the way to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the poore Patient, who beholdeth as it were a grimme devill ready to torment him. Theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being ſet upon their ſeat begin againe to charge the Priſoner voluntarily to confeſſe the truth: which if be refuſe to do, and if it then happen
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65665:15"/> that an arme or any other member of his body be broken, or that they die on the torture (for that is all the favour he hath ſhewed him) they make it his own fault and none of theirs. After they have uſed all the terrible threates that can be, they cauſe him to be ſtripped ſtarke naked, whether man, woman, or maide, though they be never ſo modeſt and baſhfull. Many having fallen into their bloody fingers, thus to have their ſhame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the ſight of others, was more gréeuous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> than all their torments beſides which they indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Laying aſide then all humanity in unclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing them, they put upon them (a ſhame it is to ſpeake it) linnen bréeches, as if their ſecret parts were better &amp; more honeſtly covered with bréeches than with a ſhirt or ſmocke, or as if the torments they meant to put them to would not pierce déepe enough as well in the one as in the other: with ſuch ſhameleſſe ſpectacles the chaſte Inquiſitors fed their ages, and with ſuch a cruell luſt ſatisfied <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> their infamous and deteſtable virginity.</p>
               <p>The man or woman ſtanding naked then, and their nakedneſſe covered only with little bréeches, as was ſaid, they becken to the tormentor, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thereby what kinde of torture he is to put them to. For herein, as alſo in many things of a like nature, they have ſome ſecret watchword or ſigne among themſelves; and the Officers being well acquainted therewith can readily diſcerne what torments the holy Fathers would have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> men put unto, to teach them the faith of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church. The moſt uſuall are the cords with the pullies, ſinewes, fire, and water, of all which we will ſpeake in place convenient. Whileſt they thus ſtand naked, they exhort them once againe to tell the truth. If the Patient be to endure the Cord, they tie his hands behinde his back, pulling him up eight or ten times, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of twitches limited by the Inquiſitor to the Tormentor; that ſo nothing may be done (there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> forſooth) without order. At the firſt incounter are reckoned up to him all his Articles; and then, beſides the binding of his hands, they tie his thumbes very hard together with a ſmall Cord, then they tie his hands and thumbes unto a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cord, hoiſing him up by a pully very high, which done, they put upon his legs heavy bolts, if hée have them not on before: to which are yet added, for the firſt pull, an iron weight of five and twenty pound, which is hanged to theſe bolts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> his féet. Being thus arayed the Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor drawes him up on high, the Regiſter and the Inquiſitor mixing therewith their former exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to confeſſe. When he comes to touch the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley with his head, they will him yet then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: if he obey, they preſently let him down; if not, then they let him hang in this condition, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he have anſwered their demands. Now, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath hung thus without making any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, they let him downe, to redouble on his féet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> the former weight. And then pulling him up againe, threaten him to hang till he there die, if hée declare not to them that which they aske of him; commanding the Tormentor to let him hang a long while in the aire, that through the heavineſſe of the weight which hangs at his feet, all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and joynts be ſtretched out beyond meaſure. When the Patient through extremity of torment, which he endures, cryes out, they in like ſort cry as loud as they can, that he ſhould now confeſſe what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> he knowes: if not, then they let him fall. For when they perceive he continues conſtant, then they command the officer to let goe the Cord, which is as ſoone done as ſpoken, yet not wholly and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the mid way, but to a certain ſtop, which hinders his falling to the ground, by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he receives ſuch a ſudden checke, that there is neither nerve, muſcle, ſinew, nor joynt in the arms or legs, nor in the whole body, which are not with extreame torture diſjoynted and diſplaced; ſo as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus ſtopped in his fall in the mid way, his body is pittifully and miſerably ſtretched out.</p>
               <p>But yet this ſufficeth not. For then if through their importunity he will confeſſe nothing, they augment the weight the third time, and thus in a manner being as good as dead, cauſe him to bée pulled up: to which cruelty they adde railing and reviling ſpéeches, calling him dog and heretike, who being obſtinate conceals the truth from them, and therefore deſerves to be left dying there. If the poore creature in regard of his intolerable ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cryeth unto Ieſus Chriſt to helpe him, and to have mercy upon him (as all ſuch doe as ſuffer for the truth) then they ſcoffe and mocke him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, Ieſus Chriſt, let this Ieſus Chriſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Impious blaſphemieſt.</note> 
                  <hi>alone a while, and tell us what that Ieſus Chriſt is thou calleſt upon?</hi> Confeſſe to us that which we demand of thée; the which teſtifies to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces how odious and hatefull a thing it is unto them to heare ſuch as ſuffer in the quarrell of Chriſt to call upon his name. If the ſorrowfull wretch deſire to be let downe, promiſing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and to tell them ſomewhat, they will for all that torment him againe. For having pauſed a little, then they tell him that is not all, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue threatning him with the Strappado as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>This helliſh torture beginneth at nine of the clocke, and laſts till noone, or one of the clocke; and when they pleaſe to make an end, then they aske of the Tormentor if he have his other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines ready, which they doe to ſtrike the greater terror into the bruiſed and martyred Patient, whom they now have in their hands. He anſwers be hath them not there, then they command him to fit and prepare them againſt the next day, and not to faile: we will ſée, ſay they, whether we can fetch the whole truth out of this fellow or no. And at their going out, they comfort the deſolate ſoule thus; <hi>This ſhall ſuffice for this time, but looke betweene this and to morrow thou adviſeſt thy ſelfe well, what thou oughteſt to confeſſe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thou art like to die on the torture; nor think to eſcape by what thou haſt endured, for that is but as a bed of Roſes in regard of the torment which is to come.</hi> Being gone, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> indevours to ſet together the joynts of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents legges and armes, as well as he can. Then his clothes being put on, he is brought againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his priſon, and if he be not able to goe, then hée is carried thither; and ſometimes this help proves a vexation unto him, in that they churliſhly hale him by his armes and legges. The Iaylour alſo in ſcorne askes of him, if he néed a Chirurgion: now if they meane to torture him no more, then he is called for two or thrée dayes after, and as he paſſeth from the priſon, they make him come nigh the doore where he was tortured, where the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor preſents himſelfe before him in all points as hath formerly béen related, that at this very ſight the priſoner in his paſſage might be put in minde of what he had but a while ſince ſuffered. When he is come before them, there he findes the Inquiſitor, the Regiſter with others ſet in their ſeates attending for him, where according to the guiſe, they adjure him to ſpeak the truth. If at that time they can draw nothing out of him, they ſend him to priſon againe. But if he happen to diſcloſe ought ſerving their turne, then they ply him hard to utter all: and thereupon make him turne thence to the torture, hoping thereby to get ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more out of him.</p>
               <p>If they purpoſe to exerciſe this their cruelty with all extremity upon the ſame Patient, they ſend for him the third day, whileſt his ſinews and joynts are in the prime of their paine, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65665:16"/> their horrible threats unto him, to reveale <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1560.</note> his hereſies, and thoſe which had formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and who they be that are of his opinion; otherwiſe he muſt prepare himſelf for the torture, wherein if he any way miſcarry in his body, or if death it ſelfe doe follow, the fault ſhall be his, and not theirs. If he continue unmovable in his mind, they cauſe the Iaylor to bring him to the place of torture, and there they ſitting in their Tribunall, command him to be ſtripped naked, and then tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> as you have formerly heard. Beſides, as an addition therto, they tie his thighs &amp; hamſtrings together with a ſmall cord, forcing the ſame ſo with pieces of wood, that the ſaid cords do eate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his very fleſh; in which extremity they leave him for ſome thrée or foure houres, or as they pleaſe, plying him the while with infinite threats and deriſions, which is all the comfort they mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to him in this his miſerable condition.</p>
               <p>They have yet another kinde of torment, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Iuſtices in other places exerciſe upon ſuch as are the moſt notorious offendors, whereof this holy Tribunall make uſe, as fitting well to their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell humour. They call it the <hi>Burno,</hi> which is a planke of timber made hollow in forme of a gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or trough, wherein a man may lie on his back; now juſt where the back bone ſhould repoſe it ſelfe, there is a round péece of wood lying over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart, kéeping up the backe from reſting in the bottome of the hollow place, ſo as it giveth no reſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> to him that is tormented thereon. Now this trough is ſo framed, that the héeles of him who is put therein lie much higher than his head. Being put into this caſe or coffin, his legges, armes, and thighes are bound hard with ſmall cords, which by little and little are ſo ſtrained with certain ſticks, that they eate into the fleſh, yea pierce to the bare bone. Then they lay a linnen cloth on his face, to hinder his breathing at the noſthrils, whileſt they poure water into his mouth, which is diſtilled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> from above by this cloth to a certaine quantity, (as it ſéemes good to his Iudge) not by drops, but ſtreaming downe, to cauſe the ſaid cloth to goe downe into his throat. The poore patient the whilſt lies in theſe torments as one in a manner dead, not being able either to ſtir or breathe. Now when this wet cloth is pulled out of the depth of his throate, to make him to anſwer unto their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; If you ſhould behold how blood and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comes out together, you would imagine they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> had plucked the very bowels out of his belly: in which wofull plight he is held as long as they thinke good, even untill with horrible threats and torments he be returned back again to priſon.</p>
               <p>If they pleaſe to procéed further in adding moe torments, within a moneth or two after the ſaid cruelties are renewed, either in more terrible or moderate manner, to ſome once, to others to the ſixt time.</p>
               <p>There is yet another torment which is peculiar <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> to this holy ſeat of the Inquiſitors. They cauſe a great fire of hot burning coales to be brought, which they apply nigh unto the ſoles of his féet whom they intend to torment, which are firſt tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly anointed with greaſe or ſuet, that the heat of the fire may pierce more déeply.</p>
               <p>Thus much be ſaid as touching theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed by thoſe cruell tormentors of the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Inquiſition of Spaine upon the bodies of poore Chriſtians. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/>

               <p>THis Iohn Herwin, born in Géeſtercoorne, &amp;c. in the Weſt ſide of Flanders, was of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute life, ſuch as ſouldiers for the moſt part are of; but God having a purpoſe to ſhew forth in him the admirable worke of converſion, to draw him to Chriſt, put it into his heart to leave his owne countrey, and come to the City of London. Béeing arrived there about Eaſter, the Lord going on with his worke brought him by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence into a Brewhouſe, being a Brewer by his calling, where he met with a maſter and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſervants fearing God; a thing ſeldome ſéen in men of that Profeſſion, ſéeing ordinarily they are exceſſive drinkers. His maſter cauſed him oft to reſort to the Dutch Church in the ſaid city of London, where by ordinary hearing of the Word preached he began firſt to taſte, and after to increaſe more and more in the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt.

The Bayliffe was mute: yet for all that Herwin was faine to take up his lodging in priſon, where hee behaved himſelfe ſo vertuouſly, that every one admired it. But becauſe hée was not called forth before the Magiſtrates of Houſcot ſo ſoone as hée deſired and expected, hée grew hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy and ſad, asking of ſome whom he knew well, if they could tell why they ſo delayed the matter? For his heart was fixed with an holy zeale to confeſſe Ieſus Chriſt before his judges. Many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> feared him much, who knew what hée had béen in times paſt; hée being as yet but a Novice, and a new commer on in the profeſſion of the Goſpell; in which caſe men for the moſt part have but ſome glimmering of the light, and are unſetled in their judgements.</p>
               <p>At length hée was brought before the ſheriffes of the towne, who commanded a Prieſt to diſpute with him. At the firſt Encounter he asked Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win how long it was ſince hée was confeſſed? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> alſo what hée thought of confeſſion, asking him ſundry other triviall queſtions, to which Herwin anſwered no leſſe modeſtly then Chriſtianly, in ſo much as they who were of ſound judgement eaſily diſcerned how hée was not the man hée had béen in times paſt, but that his priſon had béen to him a good ſchoole where hd had well conned his leſſon. The Prieſt demanded further whether he beléeved there were ſeven ſacraments or no? The bayliffe helping the Prieſt, ſaid, whats that to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> purpoſe, whether there be ſeven or two, hée will acknowledge no more then hée liſt (for he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed there were but two.) The chiefe ſheriffe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him in theſe termes, whither hée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeved that the Lord remained upon the Altar, fleſh, body, and bone. I anſwer (ſaith Herwin) with Saint Steven, that the higheſt dwelleth not in temples made with hands. Heaven, ſaith the Lord, is my throne, and the earth is my footſtoole; <note place="margin">

Hath not my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> hand made all theſe? And then tooke occaſion to admoniſh the Iudges which ſate there, to examine the Doctrine of the Romane Church, by the true touchſtone which is the holy ſcripture, that ſo they might diſcern how oppoſite and contrary the one is to the other. Conſider alſo, ſaith hée, what the words of ſaint Peter import, where hée af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes that we ought to obey God rather then man. Yea it is high time for you to thinke upon <note place="margin">

And as for the title of the Romane Catholike Church, which you hold out againſt us; I deny not but in the Apoſtles time and afterwards there was a true Church in Rome, as well as in Corinth, Galatia, among the Philippians, and in other churches; but <note place="margin">When the church of Rome was a true Church.</note> after that ſhe fell from the pure word of God, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> falſified the Sacraments thereof, turning eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall diſcipline into auricular confeſſion, God hath alſo forſaken her, &amp; ſhe ought now no more to bée called a Church of God, but rather the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan. As ſoone as the chiefe Sheriffe (who is called the firſt ſpeaker) heard this, he commanded him away.</p>
               <p>Having then given ſufficient teſtimony of his Faith, before thoſe of Houſcot, he craved for Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice either one way or another. But they on the contrary urged him to deſiſt from his opinion. To which he anſwered, that his faith was not built of <note place="margin">

Yea, ſaid they, but ſéeſt thou not how theſe opinions have troubled the World? And alſo how many of the learneder ſort do contradict them? Anſwer. So far is it off that the doctrine of the Goſpell ſhould be the cauſe of troubles, that it only is the meanes of quieting the troubles, debates, and ſtrifes which raigne in the world. Theſe troubles ariſe indéed from the malice of men. And as touching your learned men you ſpeake of, it is impoſſible for humane wiſdome to comprehend the doctrine of God: for which cauſe Chriſt ſaith. <hi>Father I thanke thee, that</hi>

                  <hi>thou haſt hid theſe ſecrets from the wiſe men of the World, and haſt revealed them to babes.</hi> Now as the Sergeants conveyed him to priſon, they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled him to ſpeake more mildly, and then he might doe well enough.</p>
               <p>Before his death he was ſorely ſet upon by certaine Sophiſters, who alledged to him the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of many of the ancient Fathers upon the point of the Lords Supper; but he overcame them, by holding cloſe the true ſenſe of Chriſts words. In priſon he comforted himſelfe in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pſalmes and ſpirituall Songs, ſome of which he indited himſelf. The Canons and prieſts ſéeing the people flock together to the priſon doore to heare him, eſpecially upon the Sundayes and holy daies, ſtrove by all meanes to put him by his ſinging. They coupled him with two malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, to be a griefe unto him: who obtaining cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine inſtruments by the helpe of their conſorts, brake priſon and fled. Herwin might thus have eſcaped if he would; but fearing his flight might be imputed to the godly Chriſtians in the City, he reſolved rather to remaine there, than to flie. His ſentence in the meane while comming from the Court, he was no ſooner advertiſed of it, but hée thanked God for advancing him to ſo high an honour as to be counted worthy to ſuffer for his name: Teſtifying the joy he inwardly had, by a Letter which he ſent to the brethren; praying and exhorting them to be conſtant and to perſevere in that Doctrine which they had received from God.</p>
               <p>The fourth day of November betwéene foure and five of the clocke in the morning Herwin was ſent for by the Magiſtrates from priſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of Iudgement, where by intreatings and goodly promiſes they urged him to recant and receive their breaden God, which was then to bée offered up; or at leaſt to confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſt was there corporally preſent, upon which he ſhould by and by be delivered out of all dangers. Now Herwin refuſing their offer was bound and brought by force into the Chappell: but he in ſign of his deteſtation, turned his backe alwayes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, ſhutting his eyes, and ſtopping his eares. At the elevation of their Hoſt, one who was knée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to it, asked him if Ieſus Chriſt was not now betwéene the Prieſts hands. No, no, ſaid Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win, he is in Heaven at the right hand of his Father.</p>
               <p>Soone after the ſentence of death was read againſt him, &amp; ſo was he delivered into the hands of the Tormentor. As he paſſed out of the town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, ſtanding upon the firſt ſtep, &amp; viewing the people who waited to ſée him, Sée here (ſaith he) how this wicked World rewards the poore ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Ieſus Chriſt. Whileſt I gave my ſelfe to drunkenneſſe, to playiug at Cards and Dice, living in all diſſolution and ungodly behaviour, I was never in danger of theſe bands (lifting up his hands which were bound) I was then counted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65665:17"/> a good fellow, and at that time who but I? But <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1561.</note> no ſooner began I by converſion to aske after a godly life, but the world made war upon me, and became my enemy, perſecuting and impriſoning me, and now laſt of all ſending me to the place where I muſt pay my laſt debt. But the ſervant is no better than his Lord: For ſéeing they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted <note place="margin">

               <p>Being come to the place where he was to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, one of the aſſembly reaching him forth his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> hand drew nigh unto him, comforting him, never leaving him till he entred into the Cabbin of wood in which he was to be burnt. He then began to ſing the thirtieth Pſalme, of which having ſung only the firſt ſtaffe, a Fryer hearing the ſame haſtned towards him (not without much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) through the throng, that he might come néere to interrupt him, who knéeling on his knées ſaid, Oh Iohn, turne, there is yet time and ſpace. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Martyr, ſleighting his gloſing words, turned his back upon him. And many there preſent cryed to the Fryer, Turne thou, thou hypocrite: and thus was he ſuffered quietly to finiſh the Pſalme. The Fryer ſéeing himſelf diſappointed this way of his purpoſe, continuing ſtill in his impudency, ſaid to the people, be ye not offended good people in hearing this Heretique ſing of God. They cryed againe to him, Hold thy peace thou Balaamite, here is no body offended. Many ſung with a ſoft voice with the Martyr, and ſome againe ſung <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> aloud without faining.</p>
               <p>There were more than foure hundred which encouraged him to continue to the end, as he had well begun. Then he ſaid unto them, Brethren, I fight under the Standard and in the quarrell of my great Lord and Captaine Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Having ended the pſalme he made his prayer to God upon his knées. Then riſing up, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to enter into his lodge made with an heape of fagots, he ſaid to the people, <hi>I am now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> going to be ſacrificed; follow you me when God of his goodneſſe ſhall call you to it.</hi> When he was gone in, the Fryer put him in minde againe, that yet there was time to repent: but he, as one little minding what this deceiver ſaid, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his ſpirit into the hands of God. Hee that reached him forth his hand ſtood in the midſt of the Sergeants, and not far off from the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor, ſtill encouraging the Patient, and yet none laid hold on him; they were ſtricken with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſuch aſtoniſhment, partly with the Martyrs cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and partly with their owne ſhame in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to death an innocent.

               <head>¶ <hi>A relation touching the Maſſacre at Vaſſy in the countrey of Champaigne in France.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Duke of Guiſe being arrived at Ioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> asked of ſuch as he was familiar with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, whether thoſe of Vaſſy uſed to have ſermons preached conſtantly by their miniſter. It was anſwered they had, and that they encreaſed daily more and more. At the hearing of which report falling into a grievous chaſe, upon Saturday the laſt of February, 1562. that he might the more covertly execute his conceived wrath againſt the religious ſort in Vaſſy, he departed from Ioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, accompanied with the Cardinall of Guiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> his brother, and thoſe of their traine, and lodged in the village of Dammartin the frée, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from Ioinville about two French miles and a halfe.</p>
               <p>The next day being Sunday, which was the firſt of March, after he had heard Maſſe very early in the morning, being attended with about two hundred men armed with harquebuſes, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols, and Coutelaxes, he left Dammartin paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing along to Vaſſy. As he went by the Village <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> of Bronzevall, which is diſtant from Vaſſy but a ſmall quarter of a mile, the bell (after the uſuall manner) rang to the Sermon. The Duke hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, asked ſuch as he met with by the way, why y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bell rung ſo loud at Vaſſy. They told him it was to give the people warning of the Sermon which was to be made there. Then one called La Montague ſaid, It is for the aſſembling of the Huguenots: adding moreover, that there were many in the ſaid Bronzevall who frequented the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> ſermons preached at Vaſſy; and therefore that the Duke ſhould do well to begin there, and offer them violence. But the Duke anſwered, March on, march on, we ſhall take them among the reſt of the aſſembly. Many who followed the Duke, to wit, pages and footmen, rejoyced not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this bloudy enterpriſe; not ſticking to ſay, that the booty and pillage would fall to their ſhares; ſwearing by blood and wounds, that there would be good ſtore of Huguenots there.</p>
               <p>Now there were certaine ſouldiers and archers accompanying the, Duke, who compaſſed about Vaſſy; for, having béene muſtered at Monthic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xender, in ſtead of returning home, as they were wont to do after the muſter was ended, they took their way thence to Vaſſy, moſt of them being lodged in the houſes of Papiſts. The Saturday before the ſlaughter they were ſéene to make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy their weapons, harquebuſes, and Piſtols: but the Faithfull not dreaming of ſuch a conſpiracy, thought the duke would offer them no hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, being the Kings ſubjects, alſo, that not above two moneths before the Duke and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren paſſing by nigh unto the ſaid Vaſſy, gave no ſigne of their diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>The Duke of Guiſe being arrived at Vaſſy with all his troupes, a young man a ſhoomaker ſtepping out of his houſe not farre from the doore where the aſſembly was, Montague pointing to him with his finger ſaid he was one of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Whereupon the Duke called this ſhooma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to him, and asked of him whether he were a Miniſter, and of what Vniverſity he was. Hee anſwered, that he was not of that Calling, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he a ſcholler. Notwithſtanding he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcaped from this troupe, which had invironed him round about: only one of the company told him, That if he had béene a Miniſter he had taken <note place="margin">So it is dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the eye of the word.</note> upon him a very baſe Calling.</p>
               <p>From thence the Duke, La Broſſe, and La Montague paſſed on in the ſaid City with their ſouldiers, as if they minded to take their way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the village of Eſclairon, where it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out hee meant to dine. But paſſing by the market houſe of Vaſſy, which is right over againſt and nigh unto the monaſtery in the way leading to Eſclairon, he turned and went directly toward the Common Hall or market houſe, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Monaſtery, where having called to him one named Deſſalles, the Prior of Vaſſy, and another whoſe name was Claude le Sain, being the Provoſt of the ſaid Vaſſy, he talked a while with them, and iſſuing haſtily out of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery was attended by many of his Followers. Then commandement was given to ſuch as were. Papiſts, to retyre into the Monaſtery, and not to be ſéene in the ſtréets, unleſſe they would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the loſſe of their lives. The Duke perceiving others of his retinue to be walking to and fro un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the towne Hall and about the Churchyard commanded them to march on towards the place where the ſermon was, being in a Barne diſtant from the Monaſtery about ſome hundred paces, quite oppoſite to that way which the Duke ſhould take to Eſclairon. This command was by and by put in execution by ſuch of the company as went on foot, going directly thither. Hee that marched formoſt of this rabble was La Broſſe, and on the ſide of theſe marched the horſemen, after whom followed the Duke with another company, as of his own followers, ſo likewiſe of thoſe of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of Guiſe his brother.</p>
               <p>By this time Maſter Leonard Morrel the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, after the firſt prayer ended, and having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun his ſermon before his auditors, which might amount to about 1200 perſons, conſiſting of men, women, and children: The horſemen firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching to the Barne within a matter of twenty five paces, ſhot off five harquebuſes right upon thoſe who were placed in the galleries joyning to the windows. The people within perceiving that, they who were nigh to the dore uſed means to ſhut it, but were diſappointed, becauſe this diſordered company preſſed in upon them: who forthwith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheathing their ſwords, cried furiouſly out, Death of God, kill, kill theſe Huguenots.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65665:18"/>
               <p>The firſt they ſeized on was a poore Cryer of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1559.</note> Wine, who ſtood next the doore, asking him, if he were not a Huguenot, and in whom he beléeved? Having anſwered that he beléeved in Ieſus Chriſt, they ſmote him twice with a ſword upon his body, which felled him to the ground. Being got up againe thinking to recover himſelfe, they ſtrucke him the third time, whereby being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with wounds he fell downe and dyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly. Two other men at the ſame time were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſlaine at the entry of the ſaid doore as they were preſſing out to eſcape.</p>
               <p>Then did the Guiſe with his company violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter in among them, ſtriking downe maine blowes upon the poore people with ſwords, dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Coutelaxes, not ſparing any age or ſex. Beſides, they within were ſo aſtonied that they knew not which way to turne them, but running hither and thither fell one upon another, flying as poore ſhéepe before a company of ravening <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Wolves entring in among the flocke.</p>
               <p>Some of the murtherers ſhot off their péeces againſt them that were in the Galleries; others cut in péeces ſuch as they lighted upon; others had their heads cleft in twaine, their arms and hands cut off, and did what they could to hew them all to péeces; ſo as many of them gave up the ghoſt even in the place. The walls and Galleries of the ſaid Barne were Dyed with the blood of thoſe who were every where murthered: yea, ſo great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> was the fury of the murtherers, that part of the people within were forced to break open the roofe of the houſe, if peradventure that way they might ſave themſelves upon the top thereof.</p>
               <p>Being got thither, and then fearing to fall again into the hands of theſe cruell tygers, ſome of them leaped over the walls of the City, which were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high, flying into the woods and amongſt the vines, which with moſt expedition they could ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt attaine unto; ſome hurt in their armes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> others in their heads and other parts of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The Duke preſented himſelfe in the houſe with his ſword drawne in his hand, charging his men to kill, eſpecially the yong men. Onely in the end women with child were ſpared. But pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing thoſe who preſſed to get upon the houſe top, they cryed, <hi>Come downe ye dogges, come downe,</hi> uſing many cruell threatning ſpéeches unto them.</p>
               <p>The cauſe why women with childe eſcaped, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> was, as the report went, for the Dutches ſake his wife, who paſſing along by the walls of the City, hearing ſo hideous out-cries which were made amongſt theſe poore creatures, with the noyſe of <note place="margin">The dutcheſſe intreats for a pacification; that thoſe of her ſex being with childe might not bee affrighted.</note> the péeces and piſtols continually diſcharged, ſent in all haſte to the Duke her husband with much entreaties to ceaſe this perſecution, for frighting women with childe.</p>
               <p>During this ſlaughter the Cardinall of Guiſe remained before the Church of the ſaid Citie of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> Vaſſi, leaning upon the wals of the church-yard, looking towards the place where his followers were buſied in killing and ſlaying whom they could. Many of this aſſembly being thus hotely purſued, did in the firſt brunt ſave themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the roofe of the houſe, not being diſcerned of thoſe which ſtood without: but at length ſome of this bloody crue eſpying where they lay hid, ſhot at them with long pieces, wherewith many of them were hurt and ſlain. The houſhold ſervants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A lamentable ſpectacle.</note> of Deſſalles Prior of Vaſſi, ſhooting at the roofe people, cauſed them to fall downe from the roofe like pigeons: one of that wretched company was not aſhamed to boaſt after the maſſacre was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That he for his part had cauſed ſixe at the leaſt to tumble downe in that pittifull plight, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if others had done the like, not many of them could poſſibly have eſcaped.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter in the beginning of the maſſacre ceaſed not to preach ſtill, till one diſcharged his piece againſt the pulpit where he ſtood, after which falling downe upon his knées, he entreated the Lord not onely to have mercy upon himſelfe, but alſo upon his poore perſecuted floke. Having ended his prayer, he left his gowne behinde him, thinking thereby to kéepe himſelfe, as unknown: b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t whileſt he approached towards the dore, in his fear he ſtumbled upon a dead body, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a blow with a ſword upon his right ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Getting up againe, and then thinking to get forth, he was immediately laid hold on and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly hurt on the head with a ſword, whereupon being felled to the ground, and féeling himſelfe mortally wounded, he cryed, <hi>Lord into thy hand I <note place="margin">Pſal. 31. 5.</note> commend my ſpirit, for thou haſt redeemed me, thou God of truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whileſt he thus prayed, one of this bloody crue ran upon him to have houghed him, but it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God his ſword brake in the hilts. Now to let you underſtand by what meanes he was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from ſo imminent a death, two gentlemen ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king knowledge of him, as the reſt were about to kill him, ſaid, it is the Miniſter, let him be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to my Lord Duke. Theſe leading him away by both the armes, brought him before the gate of the Monaſtery, from whence the Duke and the Cardinall his brother comming forth ſaid, come hither, and asked him, ſaying, Art thou the Miniſter of this place? who made thée ſo bold to ſeduce this people thus? Sir, ſaid the Miniſter, I am no ſeducer, for I have preached to them the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt. The Duke perceiving that this ſhort and pithy anſwer condemned his cruell fact, began to curſe and ſweare, ſaying, Death of God, doth the Goſpell preach ſedition? Provoſt, goe and let a Gibbet be ſet up, and hang this bougrer.</p>
               <p>At which words the Miniſter was delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of two Pages, who miſuſed him vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The women of the City being ignorant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts caught up dirt to throw in his face, and with extended outcries ſaid, Kill him, kill this varlet, who hath béen the cauſe of the ſlaughter of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Much adoe there was to hold off the women from being revenged upon the poore Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the Pages had him thus in their hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the Duke went into the barn, to whom they preſented a great Bible, which they uſed for the ſervice of God. The Duke taking it into his hands, calling his brother the Cardinall ſaid, Loe here the Title of the Huguenot books. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall viewing it, ſayd, There is nothing but good in this book, for it is the Bible, to wit, the holy Scriptures. The Duke being offended for that his anſwer ſuited not to his humor, grew into a greater rage than before, ſaying, Blood of God, how now? what? the holy Scripture. It is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and five hundred yéerey agoe ſince Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered his death and paſſion, and it is but a yéere ſince theſe bookes were imprinted, how then ſay you that this is the Goſpell? by the death of God you ſay you know not what. This imbridled fury of the Duke diſpleaſed the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, ſo as he was heard ſecretly to mutter, <hi>An unworthy Brother.</hi> This Maſſacre continued a full houre, the Dukes trumpeters ſounding the whilſt two ſeverall times. When any of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have mercy ſhewed them for the love of Ieſus Chriſt, the murtherers in ſcorne would ſay unto them, you uſe the name of Chriſt, but where is your Chriſt now become? And when they ſaid Lord God, they blaſphemingly would <note place="margin">A grievous ſcorne.</note> ſay, Lord devill.</p>
               <p>There dyed in this Maſſacre within a few daies fifty or thréeſcore perſons; beſides theſe, there were about two hundred and fifty others as well

Nothing was to be ſéene in the ſtréets but Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with their haire hanging about their eares, faces beſmeared with blood, being wounded in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> many places with ſwords and daggers, with wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings and lamentations. Barbers and Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were ſo ſet on worke, that he which had leaſt had thréeſcore under his hand to be dreſſed, and many periſhed for want thereof.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter was kept cloſe priſoner, ſo as for foure and twenty houres none were permitted to ſupply him with any neceſſaries at all, nor any ſuffered to ſée him or ſpeake with him, and was oft threatned by his kéepers to be ſowed up in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſack and drowned. Faine would they have drawn him to have kept his Eaſter after the Popiſh guiſe, under faire premiſes of his inlargement; but he would by no means conſent thereto. Thus continued he priſoner untill the eight day of May, 1563. at which time he was ſet frée by the ſuit of the moſt illuſtrious prince of Portion.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the Duke was at Eſclairon, the Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys and others of their ſort put to ſale, unto ſuch as would give moſt, cloaks, hats, girdles, Coifes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Kerchiefes, with other things which they had ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the maſſacred of; Crying them with a loud voyce, as if a common cryer had cryed houſhold ſtuffe to be ſold.</p>

Some that had béen his Iudges, comming into the priſon, demanded of him if he bare them not ill will: he anſwered, that men of his profeſſion and religion ought not to malice any, no not their enemies, being rather enjoyned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> by God to love and pray for thoſe that perſecuted them; ſhewing furthermore, that whatſoever troubles had befallen him were none other but ſuch as God had foreordained for the ſetting forth of his owne glory; for which he eſtéemed himſelfe moſt happy: only he warned them to bethinke themſelves well what wrong they had offered him, leſt the vengeance of God might ſometime or other overtake them.</p>
               <p>The next day, being the twelfth of April, Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> having received letters from the Conſtable for the enlargement of Fournier, being ſollicited thereto by the Captaine of La Tournelle; in ſtead of obeying the Conſtables command ſware that he ſhould be delivered indéed, that is to ſay, into the hands of the multitude: and thus ſtiffely refuſing either the publication of the letters, or to obſerve the Edict, cauſed thrée of his priſoners of the religion to be put into the dungeon, becauſe he heard them ſing Pſalmes.</p>

Which they promiſing to doe, at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne they ſo far prevailed with Buſſi, that he conſented to what they had ſo promiſed. And thus on the laſt of April (which was eight moneths <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſince Fournier was firſt impriſoned) the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Godet, and the Abbat of All Saints, with ſome others reſorted to him, declaring that they were willing now to ſet him at liberty; entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him now to forgive and forget that which was paſt, that the Prince might ſée how forward they were to gratifie him herein. Fournier was brought into a Cathedrall Church not farre from the priſon, where he found the Captaine of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with a great company of armed men ready to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> conduct him out of towne. But the place was forthwith beſet with people whom Buſſi to that purpoſe had ſtirred up, ſo that had it not béen for thoſe who defended him within, and an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſhowre of raine comming betwéene of long continuance, which cauſe the greater part of the ſeditious to depart, Fournier had hardly eſcaped their hands, if a meanes had not béen found to let him out by a back doore.</p>
               <p>It is here to be noted, that upon the eighth day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> of October the Biſhop of Chaalons calling Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier into his garden, endeavouring to turne him from the faith, ſaid, I marvell how you, being an ancient Doctor in Divinity, of the age of fifty eight yeares, and ſo well learned in the tongues, ſhould be thus led aſide with theſe opinions, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving credit ſo ſuddenly to the writings of Calvin and others. To Calvin? ſaid Fournier, you ſhould rather have ſaid, by beléeving and giving credit to the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Godet beſtirring him, and being now farre more willing to ſave the ſaid Fourniers life, than <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> he had béen formerly to deprive him of it, in the evening bringing him to his owne houſe, and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him in his owne bed, did what he could the next day very early to ſend for the keyes of the City gates. Which when he could not obtain of Buſſi, who kept the gatesfaſt ſhut for feare of the Swart Ruttors, he then endeavoured to bring the ſaid Fournier ſecretly by a back way, to an houſe néere to the gate of the ſaid City; ſo as at eleven of the clocke, certaine Coaches going out, he was ſhuffled out amidſt them, and himſelfe brought him on the way about a quarter of a mile; where he was by and by received by thoſe who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended there for him, with a charge to bring him to their Prince, who at that time was in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Songz: Where he was kindly welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the ſaid Lord, and of all his friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, having compaſſion on him, in regard that now being fifty eight yeares old, he had ſuffered ſo many hard encounters. And within two dayes after he preached before the prince and all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; and the day following, at the inſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of thoſe of Vitri, went thither to preach and baptiſe children, the Prince being preſent there in his own perſon. At length Fournier, gathering a Church together at a place called Ver, ſpent ſome ſmall portion of time among his Flocke there, with wonderfull fruit: being ſore weakned when he was in priſon, (what with ſtrait dyet, and the extremity of the torture) he ſoone after finiſhed his courſe, leaving to poſterity a rare memory of his conſtancy and piety.</p>

Upon this mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her motherly affection cauſed her to ſhed plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of teares: but by and by taking unto her new courage, <hi>I muſt needs tell you,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that I love my children dearly: but yet neither for love I bear to them or any thing elſe in this world, will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the truth, or my God, who is and will be a Father unto them, to provide better for them than I could have done; and therefore to his providence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> and protection I commend and leave them;</hi> and ſo paſſed on chéerfully without being any further daunted.</p>

               <p>THere was one Iohn Wolfe of the City of Audenard, who becauſe he could no longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> there, without either the danger of his life, or wounding of his conſcience, his wife being great with childe, and as yet but weake in the knowledge of the Goſpell, he was forced for theſe reſpects to joyne himſelfe to the aſſembly of the Church in Antwerpe, where thinking himſelfe in ſafety, a neighbour of his owing him ill will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him to the Margrave about the baptiſing of his childe. Whereupon being then committed, and examined where and in whoſe preſence his childe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> was baptized, he without ſtaggering anſwered, that he had it baptiſed according to the inſtitution of Chriſt, by a Miniſter ſet apart to that Office. The Margrave, not content with this anſwer, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten preſſed him with ſundry threats of the torture to accuſe ſuch as he knew. But the ſharpeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat he endured was from his owne fleſh, counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him during his impriſonment, for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his life, to diſſemble and halt betwéen two opinions. The cauſe was from the inward affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> he bore towards his wife and childe, being yet but young and of ſingular beauty; in regard whereof many of the congregation expected no other but that he would ſinke under this tryall.</p>
               <p>But in the middeſt of theſe aſſaults hée was heard, with prayers and ſighes, to cry mightily to God to bée delivered from this temptation.

Whereby in the end he continued ſo ſtrong in the Lord, as alſo conſtant in the confeſſion of the truth, that in concluſion he received the ſentence of death with the aforeſaid Wouter. After which his wife came unto him, and they were permitted to talke together, burſting out each of them into ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of teares, that it would have moved the moſt ſtony heart that ever was.

               </argument>
               <p>WHileſt the perſecution continued at this time in ſundry places of Flanders, under Philip King of Spaine, and that many fled into England under the protection of Quéene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth; theſe thrée above mentioned were of the ſame number, who joyned themſelves to the Dutch Church in London, having given publique teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their faith before all the Congregation. In which place they continuod not long, but they were conſtrained upon ſome ſpeciall occaſions to returne into their owne countrey againe, taking boat about the end of Iune, Anno 1560.</p>
               <p>They were no ſooner arrived at Nieuport, but two of them, to wit, Iames and Ieane, endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to paſſe on to Honſcot, leaving Chriſtian to come at his leiſure, becauſe he was not well at eaſe, having alſo a fardel of ſmall books of religion.</p>
               <p>The Bailife with ſome others méting him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way, asked him whence he came and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was going, as alſo what he was. Chriſtian framed them ſuch an anſwer that they could take no advantage againſt him (travelling as hée did upon the way) onely they ſpied about him that far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell of books, by occaſion whereof they brought him backe into the City: and having learned that he came over wiſh two others, the Bailiffe forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſent his lievtenant towards Honſcot; who ſo wilily handled the matter, that in the end he caught them, and brought them bound to the City of Furn. Where for a few daies they were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners together with the foreſaid Chriſtian; in which condition they mutually comforted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged one another: but their adverſaries ſoone ſeparated them, thinking therby to weaken their ſtrength, conſtancy, and fortitude.</p>
               <p>Upon the firſt of their interrogatories (which was about the third and fourth of Iuly) they aſked Iames why he ſeparated from the church of Rome</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe it is not the church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How know you that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Becauſe it hath neither the Word of God ſoundly preached, the Sacraments duly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, nor the Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline after a right manner executed. Iames gave good and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid reaſons hereof; ſhewing that in their Church was taught, that ſoules muſt bée ſaved by ſaying of Maſſes, long prayers, invocation of ſaints, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, with other ſuch vaine and deceivable hopes; yea, ſaid the Prieſt, doe you thus judge of thoſe who give to Ieſus Chriſt bread when he is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65665:23"/> hungry, and drinke when he is thirſty, and cloath <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1563.</note> him being naked, &amp;c. And ſo went on with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying many words, not ſuffering the ſaid Iames to finiſh what he was about to have ſaid. Others asked him if he could prove that they had not the true adminiſtration of Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> You have ſo obſcured it with your owne additions, that a man can ſcarce diſcerne it to be Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What thinke you then of your owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Were I now to be baptiſed, I would not receive it from your Church, ſo well it likes me that I have received it from you. Being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what he ſaid to the Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, he proved evidently how farre off it was from the firſt inſtitution of the Lords ſupper. And as concerning the Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, hée uttered more of their corrupting of it, then they were willing to heare. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> 
               </p>
               <p>After this, they were examined by two friers, who were choſen out for the purpoſe; one of them was Iohn Campo, ſuperintendent of the Gray Friers of Dixmude, the other was called Peter Pennet Prior of the Carmelites in Ypre. Theſe two examined the thrée priſoners firſt upon the articles of the faith; and then, if they beléeved that Chriſt was made of the ſéed of the woman? Iames anſwered, we are all perſwaded that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was made of the ſéed of the woman, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> as God hath promiſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, of the ſéed of Abraham, add of David; and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15.</note> that he was in all things made like unto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſinne onely excepted.</p>
               <p>After many other queſtions upon divers points, they were asked, whether in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the Maſſe the body of Chriſt was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there or no? No, ſaid Iames, It is nothing like the Lords Supper which Chriſt gave to them that ſate at table with him: According to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> which inſtitution the faithfull being aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42. brake bread, &amp;c. Nor ſhall ye find in the Scriptures, that one alone receiveth, or that the reſt ſtood and looked on. And if Saint Paul juſtly challenged the Corinthians, becauſe every oue was forward to eat his owne ſupper apart, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20.</note> much more are you worthy of their reprehenſion. I doe therefore ranke you amongſt thoſe falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath warned <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 24 23.</note> us of, who will ſay thus unto us, <hi>Lo, here is Chriſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> and there he is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereunto the adverſaries replyed, Doth not Chriſt in expreſſe words ſay, <hi>This is my body; This is my bloud?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The words muſt not be taken as they ſound in a literall ſence, for ſo they ſhall have no agréement with other like places of Scripture. You know the words belonging to the antient Sacraments were expounded by the holy Ghoſt himſelfe; Circumciſion is called the Covenant, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> and the Lambe is called the Paſſeover, albeit they were but the ſignes thereof.</p>
               <p>They asked if God were not omnipotent.</p>
               <p>Yes, ſaid Iames, but yet he will doe nothing againſt his Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> If the bread be not changed, why doth <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29.</note> Saint Paul affirme, That whoſoever eats of this bread unworthily, eats judgement to himſelfe, not diſcerning the Lords body.</p>
               <p>Wée acknowledge all this, ſaid they, becauſe a man ought to examine himſelfe, before he preſume <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> to come to that holy banquet; for in the Supper we receive not only bread and wine, but doe alſo truly partake of the body and bloud of Chriſt, as Saint Paul teacheth us. <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Matrimony.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>In the fourth place, they were asked if mariage were not a Sacrament? No, ſaid Iames, for ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not things indifferent to Chriſtians, as mariage is; for Saint Paul ſaith, he that gives <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 8. 29. 38.</note> his Virgin in mariage doth well, but hee that gives her not in mariage doth better.

They had many other diſputes, which Iames could not write for want of paper, as he intimated to them of the Church.</p>
               <p>The fourtéenth of Auguſt they were examined the third time by Peter Titleman Dean of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay, Inquiſitor generall of Flanders, whoſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties and extortions were exerciſed upon all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> faithfull, in all the perſecutions and deaths which they ſuffered in the ſaid Countrey. This morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was brought before him Iane Solomez, of whom he diligently enquired of theſe of the City of Stéenewerke where ſhe was borne; but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if ſhe knew one Charles Vanderkaw, a man renowned among the faithfull there. She anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe knew him, but he was now dead. After he had asked her name, he queſtioned with her, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> eſpecially about the Sacraments, yea ſomewhat concerning the Lords Supper, holding her in theſe diſcourſes about two houres before him.</p>
               <p>To Iames Dienſart he propounded no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but came about him with theſe flattering ſpéeches; My ſon, you are yong and in the prime of your youth: Therefore the Magiſtrate of this City is very deſirous you ſhould be withdrawne from holding this new doctrine, that ſo you might be brought againe into the right way; but as I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> underſtand, you ſo perſiſt therein, that there is no removing of you. Iames anſwered that it could not be called a new doctrine, which was built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prophets and Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>To whom the Inquiſitor replyed, That Martin Luther was the firſt that broached it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> And what ſay you then to ſo many learned men which lived before him, as Io. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe, Iohn Hus, &amp;c. and ſome after him, as Calvin, Iohn Alaſco, Martin Micron, and others in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> France, and Frieſland? And though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you nor I knew them, God knowes them as well as he did the ſeven thouſand of the godly, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19. 28.</note> whom Elias in his dayes was ignorant of. The Inquiſitor, perſiſting in his old ſong, preſſed him with the ſucceſſion of his Prelates and Biſhops. Iames put him in minde of another marke of the true Church, namely that it was alwaies under perſecution; and thence inferred that himſelfe was a true member thereof.</p>
               <p>The Inquiſitor ſaid, we are now perſecuted in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> England: for now they begin to impriſon ſome of our Prieſts there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is true that Boner late Biſhop of London was committed to priſon, but not for his good déeds. The reſt of them have their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>Now this Inquiſitor among other matters willing him to ſhew what ſervice was due to the Virgine Mary, ſaid, Is it not written, <hi>Honour</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>all men?</hi> And what honour owe we then to the mother of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>You give her (ſaid Iames) a goodly honour in bowing the knée before an Image of wood or ſtone, praying thereto as to your God. You may be aſhamed of ſuch abhominable practiſes and blaſphemies. Much other reaſonings they had, which the ſaid Iames, for lacke of paper and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, could not commit to writing.</p>
               <p>The ſame day in the afternoon Chriſtian Luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kere, who was put into priſon apart, was alſo preſented before this inquiſitor, and examined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many Articles. In all his anſwers he ſhewed much courage; and when the other went about to prove that Ieſus Chriſt was corporally preſent in the Sacraments, Chriſtian uſed ſixe or ſeven ſtrong reaſons to the contrary drawne out of the holy Scriptures, That it could by no meanes be granted, being repugnant to the truth. The adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries perceiving the conſtancy of theſe thrée pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, ſought by all meanes to vexe and weaken them. Firſt they ſevered them one from another to deprive them of mutuall comfort and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, gave charge, that in viſiting them none ſhould be ſo bold as to bring them ought to eate or drink. Thirdly, They were ſollicited by wicked ones to yéeld, and not wilfully to hazard their lives. Moreover, they had many other greaf provocations; and therefore by their Letters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly requeſted the continuall prayers of the Churches to God for them.</p>
               <p>When the godly ſtrangers in England were advertiſed of theſe their aſſaults, they ſollicited their Superintendent Edmund Biſhop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, at the requeſt of the Archbiſh. of Canterbury, and others, to ſend Letters to the Magiſtrates of Furne, intreating that they would releaſe theſe thrée priſoners, whom they had apprehended as they paſſed along by the high waies ſide, without any misbehaving of themſelves, or holding any diſpute with any, and were innocent in regard of committing ought againſt the Lawes of the Countrey. As touching their Faith which ſome called into queſtion, they ſhould not for that bée moleſted; becauſe in like manner her Majeſty hath given frée power and leave in caſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hitherto, that none of the Subjects of the Low-Countries, comming into England, and carrying themſelves modeſtly, ſhould be medled withall. But if they ſhall deale ſo hardly with thoſe of the Religion, who have ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as her Majeſties ſubjects under her prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then ſhe ſhall be conſtrained, though to her great ſorrow, to mete out the ſame meaſure to thoſe of other Nations; but ſhe hoped and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the contrary, both from the wisdome and equity of the Magiſtrates of Furne.</p>
               <p>Theſe Letters were dated the 26. of Iuly 1560. and ſubſcribed.</p>

               <p>THe Magiſtrates of Furne having received theſe Letters ſent them to Bruxels, where they were read before the Kings privy Counſell. But to extenuate the authority thereof, it was noiſed that they were forged by ſome Lutherans; ſo as in the end they reſolved (notwithſtanding) to procéed againſt the ſaid priſoners, according to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the Lawes eſtabliſhed by the King.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65665:24"/> Now theſe of Furne having in vaine by all <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1562.</note> meanes aſſayed to turne the priſoners from their Faith, they reſolved to execute them. Many of the City, and others not dwelling far off, hearing the report of their purpoſed diſpatch, prepared to come to the ſight thereof, thinking it would have béen on Wednesday which was Market-day. But the Magiſtrates taking notice of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude were ſomewhat amaſed, and cauſed him that was to doe execution to ride through the middeſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> of the Market at high noone, as if he had béen ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his journey out of the City, and ſo to make the people beléeve that they intended not their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution as yet. But on Wednesday towards the evening, the chiefe Bailiffe accompanied with ſome of the Magiſtrates, came ſecretly into the priſon, ſolliciting each of the ſaid priſoners with many intreaties and intiſing perſwaſions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; promiſing to ſet them free forthwith, if they would ſpeake but one word to that purpoſe. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the Lord ſtrengthned them ſo, that they overcame this dangerous aſſault. The adverſaries, ſéeing their expectations fruſtrated, cauſed all things the ſame night to be made ready for their execution the next day; to wit, chaines, ſtakes, fagots, &amp;c. Now the Lord, who hath the diſpoſing of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of time in his owne hands, diſappointed this project by a vehement ſhower of raine, which he ſent, continuing all the forenoone.</p>
               <p>The two Fryers formerly mentioned were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> called for; each of them accompanied with one of their own coat. Theſe began to aſſaile the priſoners from morning till eight of the clock, either to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or elſe to turne them from their faith. Which becauſe they could effect neither upon Iames nor Chriſtian, they dealt with Iane, thinking to have prevailed with her; but to as little purpoſe as with the two others. Being thus diſappointed of their hopes, then they fled to their accuſtomed lies, which they term <hi>Fraudes pieuſes,</hi> pious beguilings, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſaying thus unto her; Will you only ſhew your ſelfe ſingular in cleaving to this opinion, whereas your priſon fellowes have renounced it?</p>
               <p>The holy Virgin was nothing abaſhed thereat, but gave them this anſwer, That ſhe could not beléeve it; and albeit it were ſo, yet would ſhée never goe back from ſo certaine a truth, grounded not upon man, but upon Ieſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Theſe lying Fryers, nothing prevailing with her neither, went their way. Then the priſoners <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> encouraging one another, and preparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for death, ſang the ſeventy fourth Pſalme. The Magiſtrates of Furne, that they might with the more ſecurity execute their ſentence, cauſed the gates of the city to be ſhut; and yet many got in, leaving their ſwords and ſtaves at the gate. Now as they brought the priſoners along to the towne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe every one as they went reached forth their hand to them, and bad them that they ſhould be of good courage. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> 
               </p>
               <p>Appearing before the Magiſtrates they were denounced heretiques. To which Chriſtian, in the name of the reſt, ſaid, Not one of your doctors can prove us heretiques, nor can they convince us by Scripture. It was replyed that they ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Sacraments. To which they fréely anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, We hold and allow thoſe Sacraments inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God, in much more reverence than you. Upon this the Magiſtrates conſulted together apart, and after a while came to their ſeats again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> pronoucing ſentence againſt theſe thrée, <hi>viz.</hi> to be ſtrangled, and then burned or ſcortched, and the remainder of the bodies to be hanged on the gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet. They thanked the judges for their ſentence; yet advertiſing them well to bethinke themſelves of what they had done. As they were paſſing forth of the houſe to be led to the ſlaughter, many of the godly bad them farewell; comforting, incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and exhorting them to continue conſtant. Whereat the head Bailiffe being much vexed puſhed Iane ſo violently with his foot, that ſhe fell downe the ſtaires, at which the people were much moved. Chriſtian went formoſt, Iane next, and Iames followed. In beholding of which ſpectacle few there were which brake not forth into ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, cryings, and teares, whileſt they gave the people ſo holy and godly exhortations. One of the Monks called Iohn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>els, being by, gave to Iane (many of good credit hearing it) this counſell in his Language, <hi>Fight valiantly, the crowne of immortality is ready for you.</hi> Whileſt the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner began to faſten their neck and féet with chanes to the ſtake, they ſung the hundred and thirtieth Pſalme, <hi>Out of the deep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fryer Iohn Campone, being impatient of ſuch an harmony, yelled out like a mad man, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This ſhewes you are not Chriſtians; for Chriſt went to his death wéeping. One in the middle of the aſſembly cryed as faſt on the other ſide, Thou lieſt thou falſe Prophet. Having fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the two firſt ſtaves of the Pſalme, the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being about to ſtrangle Chriſtian, the other two ceaſed, crying to their brother; Be of good chéere and play the man. And Chriſtian, lifting up his eyes to heaven, ſaid twice or thrice, Lord God heavenly father into thy hands I commend my ſpirit. And then againe, Lord forgive their ſin who have put us to death. Iames and the maide made the like prayer. But becauſe Iames was laſt ſtrangled, and the people moved with compaſſion began to ſtir, the hangman kindled the fire upon Iames being but halfe ſtrangled. The people ſéeing him to die in the midſt of the fire, were yet more moved, ſo as the tormentor being in a maze got a ſtaffe out of a Boat headed with iron, and ſmote the Martyr twice or thrice on the right ſide, to make an end of him. Theſe thrée having a while lien in the fire, they were carried thence in a cart to the gibbet, where being put apart upon thrée poles they were afterward taken downe and buried.</p>

               <p>NIcaiſe dwelling in Tournay, and following the trade of Say-making, towards the end of his life, was then by the mercy of God brought to the knowledge of true religion. Now that he might be the more throughly inſtructed therein, he went with his wife and family into the City of Weſell in baſe Almaine. In which City there was at that time an aſſembly of ſtrangers, and eſpecially of thoſe who are called Wallons, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing themſelves in hearing the word of God purely preached, and in receiving the holy ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But Satan the mortall enemy of Gods children, envying their happineſſe, ſoon after trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled this aſſembly in ſuch wiſe with ſundry que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, that ſome retyred to Frankfort, others to Strausburg, and ſome to other places.

               <p>Where notice being taken of him, they received him into their ſociety, amongſt whom he carried himſelfe in ſo Chriſtian a ſort, as they well percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

Now foraſmuch as afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 9. 10.</note> is the true touchſtone whereby the faithfull are diſcerned from Hypocrites; Nicaiſe then ſhewed outwardly what he was within. For being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned to take an oath from thoſe who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted thereunto by the King of Spaine, to live according to the cuſtome of the Romiſh Church, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and to obſerve the traditions invented by her; he, notwithſtanding the threats and injuries done unto him, conſtantly held out againſt the ſaid oath, not caſting how deare it might coſt him in the end. Some of his kindred wiſhed him at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to withdraw himſelfe aſide for awhile into another City, till the urging of this oath was over, as alſo that his wife ſhould change her lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in his abſence.</p>
               <p>To this counſell he conſented; but the Lord, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> who governes all our intentions and purpoſes, had otherwiſe determined of him, namely to ſet him forth as an example of conſtancy unto others, and to beare witneſſe ſo farre to the truth of the Goſpell, as to ſeale the ſame with his bloud, by ſtaying him at that time in the City. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to take his journey, a néere neighbour of his, being an enemy of the Goſpell, accuſed him to the commiſſioners for one that neither had nor would take the oath according to the forme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> appointed. Nicaiſe requiring to heare the tenour of the oath, before he would make them an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they told him that he muſt ſweare to kéep &amp; obſerve all antient cuſtomes; to receive in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the altar his creatour thrice in the yeare, and on Sundaies and Holidaies to heare Maſſe, morning and evening. As ſoone as hée had underſtood their meaning, hée told them, hée intended not at all to take any ſuch oath, nor to wound his conſcience in conſenting to things ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> manifeſtly contradicting the word of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall yéelding them the reaſons of this his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; accuſing as well them for urging ſuch an oath, as thoſe alſo who gave their conſents thereto. Upon this he was committed and laid amongſt fellons, in the Gaole called Pipigne, untill Friday the twelfth of November, on which day he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſentence of death; namely to be bound and ſo led into the Market place of the City, and there upon a Scaffold to be burned and conſumed to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> aſhes.</p>
               <p>Having heard this ſentence, as he roſe up, hée ſaid, now praiſed be God; and as he was about to have ſpoken more at large, the Procurer fiſcall bing preſent prevented him, and thruſting him forward bad him march on. By and by they brought him to the place of execution; and as it well fell out, having no Prieſt accompanying him, when he was come downe to the Market place, a néere friend of his comming to him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> him to God, and ſo they kiſſed each other.</p>

               </p>
               <p>He alſo prayed all whom he had any way offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to forgive him, as he for his part was ready to forgive all the world.

Which the people per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving began to be moved ſo much the more, ſo as there had like to have béen a great tnmult. But going on they drew nigh to the place where the ſcaffold was.</p>
               <p>Nicaiſe all the while ſpent the time in prayer unto God, and being at the place of execution hée uttered theſe words; <hi>Lord, they have hated mee without a cauſe;</hi> and aſcended up joyfully to the ſcaffold: where the Tormentors readily received him, and led him to the ſtake; and as they were faſtening him to it, he ſaid, <hi>Eternall Father, have pitty and compaſſion upon me, according as thou haſt promiſed to all that aske the ſame of thee in thy ſonnes name.</hi> Other prayers he made there to his God, and ſo continued to his laſt gaſpe. And albeit the multitude made ſuch a noiſe, and the beating of the drummes hindred his words from being all fully heard; yet he ſo often pronounced, and that with ſuch vehemency, the word Ieſus, that it notwithſtanding might plainly be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as long as the breath was in his body. And thus yée have heard the godly life and bleſſed end of this conſtant martyr.</p>

               <p>YOu may eaſily diſcerne by the former Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that the cruelties exerciſed againſt the Faithfull in Flanders nothing diminiſhed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of them; for the innocent bloud thus ſhed was a meanes to bring many ignorant ſoules to the knowledge of the Truth. Theſe foure above named, dwelling in the City of Liſle, walked in the feare of the Lord, with zeale according to knowledge, as the event well manifeſted.</p>
               <p>There was a Ieſuit in the ſaid City who had a ſervant that was couſin to one of the Martyrs, with whom they laboured, not without ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, firſt to ſhew him the odiouſneſſe of that ſect, and then to inſtruct him in the doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell. To which purpoſe they lent him a booke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining good inſtructions drawne out of the holy Scriptures. The ſilly fellow, not conſidering the hurt that might follow, ſhewed it ſoone after to his Maſter. The falſe Prophet by and by knew that this booke was not forged upon his anvile, and therefore diligently enquired of his man where he had it. Now that he might with the more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attaine his deſire, he gave him a piece of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſtivers, telling him he ſhould do well to bring him to the knowledge of them from whom he had received it; which was not hard to doe, in regard they all foure wrought upon their Trade (which was to dreſſe ſayes) in an honeſt widowes houſe who profeſſed the ſame Religion with them.</p>
               <p>The Ieſuite comming to the knowledge hereof failed not, according to their guiſe, to reveale it to the Magiſtrate. Now leſt he might be ſuſpected to be the betrayer of them, the Fox withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the ſame time out of the City, whilſt on a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday morning about two of the clocke theſe foure were apprehended and impriſoned by the Magiſtrate. It fell out the ſame day, that certain writings were ſet up upon the Towne-houſe againſt the horrible tyranny of the Spaniſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, which was then intended to be brought in and executed throughout the Low-Countries, which no doubt was the meanes wherby the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates were the rather incenſed againſt the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. But foraſmuch as they were not found guilty of having any hand in this buſineſſe, they were onely examined about matters concerning
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65665:25"/> their Faith. To which they anſwered with ſuch <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1566.</note> courage and conſtancy, without varying or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, that the Iailour wondred how they could anſwer the Iudges ſo directly and pertinently (as it were with one conſent) being notwithſtanding ſevered one from another in the priſon.</p>
               <p>The ſecond of March, 1566. they were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for heretiques by the Provoſt of the City, to which they replyed, that if they were Heretiques then Gods word muſt néeds be hereſie, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> could not be; and therefore they fréely proteſted before all, that they were Chriſtians, and held no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which was agréeable to the word of God. They were asked if they would ſubmit themſelves to the will of the Magiſtrates. They anſwered they would ſubmit themſelves to the will of God. Then was ſentence of death forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with pronounced upon them, which was, that they ſhould be burned alive before the Towne-houſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> When they were brought out of Priſon to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, Noels father came and embraced him, and kiſſing him ſaid, Art thou led my ſon in this ſort unto death? This is nothing, Father, ſaid hée, for now am I going to life. And howſoever Noel wept in going up to the Scaffold, ſéeing his father ſo diſſolved into teares; yet recovering himſelfe, and being armed with new courage, he cryed, O yée Prieſts, if we would have gone to your Maſſe, we néeded not to have béen here: but Ieſus Chriſt never commanded nor inſtituted any ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> thing.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts ſtanding at the foot of the ſcaffold laboured to make the people beéeve they were Heretiques, and that their faith was the faith of devills, becauſe they rejected the Sacraments. But to that one of them anſwered, that their Faith was nothing like to that of devills; and as touching the Sacraments, they held ſo many as Chriſt ordained. Then ſaid Martin, ſuffer us to die in peace, for we are in the right way, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> are going to Ieſus Chriſt, hinder us not in this our journey; with theſe and the like ſpéeches the Prieſts mouthes were ſtopped, not daring to come up upon the Scaffold, as they were wont to doe.</p>
               <p>Iohn Dauticourt comming up recited the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Créed, adding ſomewhat by way of expoſition upon every Article. Thoſe who knew him before his impriſonment marvelled to heare him ſpeake ſo judiciouſly. The executioner think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> to pleaſe his Maſters offered to gag him: but the patient promiſed to hold his peace. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtraitly faſtened to the ſtake by the necke, he ſaid to the people; O my friends, were it for ſpeaking wickedly that they commanded me to be ſilent, it were ſomewhat, but I cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſpeake unto you the word of God, and with a loud voice ſaid, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, or anguiſh? O Lord, we are delivered to death for thy ſake, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> and are appointed as ſheepe for the ſlaughter. But let us be of good cheere my brethren, for wee ſhall be more than conquerours, through him that loved us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other thrée on their parts cryed and ſaid, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>This, this is the way that leads to life; this is the ſtrait way by which we muſt enter thereinto, as Chriſt our Lord hath taught us.</hi> Noel likewiſe ſaid, <hi>Enter you my brethren, and whileſt I am alive pray for me; for after death prayers prevaile not.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> When all of them were faſtened to their ſtakes, and covered with fagots, with fire ready to ſet thereto, they began with one voice to ſing the firſt part of the ſeven and twentieth Pſalme, and after that the ſong of Simeon to the end: after which the fire began to be kindled, in the middeſt whereof they were heard to cry ten or twelve times to the Lord, eſpecially Iohn and Noel, with loud voices calling and ſaying, <hi>Lord receive us this day unto mercy, and unto thy kingdome.</hi> And thus ceaſing to cry any more, they yéelded up their ſoules into the hands of God. This conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of theirs, procéeding from the worke of Gods Spirit, was not without ſingular fruit, for the inlarging of the Church; for many being touched therewith went home thence, as if they had gone from a powerfull ſermon.</p>

               <head>¶ <hi>Francis D' Aloſt in Flanders, Martyr, in the yeare 1566.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis yong man, being by his trade a Cutler, during the time of his ignorance frequented the Court much, and tooke great delight in the vanity of this world, which gat him much reſpect of many, but chiefly among thoſe of the Romiſh Religion, namely Prieſts and Monkes, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly converſed with him, taking much content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his carriage and courſe of life. But as ſoone as God of his goodneſſe by the meanes of his word had revealed unto him his ſon Ieſus Chriſt, he by and by altered and changed his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer converſation: for having before lived in great diſſoluteneſſe, he now ſharply reproved ſuch as he knew to follow ſinfull wayes; yea, he often taxed the Prieſts as well for their ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous living as for their falſe doctrine, wherewith they abuſed the people; but principally for making them to fall downe to ſuch a god as could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend nor kéep himſelfe from Rats and Nice, and which is worſe, to offer it up for the ſins of the quick and the dead.</p>
               <p>For theſe with other ſuch like ſpéeches, thoſe who erewhiles loved him began now to turne their love into hatred, inſomuch as he was faine to flie from them, yea, and out of the Countrey alſo, being baniſhed thence; threatning him, that if he were taken there againe, he ſhould be put to death, not as an heretike, but as one having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the penall Lawes. But not long after the Lord wrought ſuch an alteration not only in the Politicall but in the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate alſo, that not the Lawes concerning hereſie alone were diſanulled, but frée liberty was granted to the Faithfull of the Low-countries, to returne home into their houſes againe, and to have the exerciſes of Religion, publikely and openly. Among theſe Francis returned at that time unto the City in which he was borne. But this fréedome ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly granted laſted not long. For the devill, not enduring the light ſo to ſhine out, ſtirred up Imps afreſh to oppreſſe the godly. Francis then apprehending the danger, was minded one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to depart out of the City; but God had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worke for him to doe. For as he was paſſing along, he was apprehended in the ſtréete by one of the City, who with the Bailiffe met him. The Bailiffe would faine have baulked him, as if he had not ſéene him; but ſaid the other, here he is, hold him faſt; ſo they took him. Being conducted to priſon, among other ſpéeches he ſaid, now yée have taken me, you thinke to deprive me of life, and ſo have your will of me, purpoſing my great dammage and hurt; but you are deceived, for it is all one, as if you tooke Counters from me, to fill my hand with a great ſumme of gold.</p>
               <p>In priſon he had many diſputes with Prieſts and Cloiſter-men. But the Iailour of all other dealt harſhly with him, who could not endure to heare him ſpeake of God. But if at any time he heard him ſing Pſalmes and ſpirituall Songs, he would rage like a Bedlam. Once being very drunke, he ſet open the priſon doores, and ſitting on a bench he called to Francis, ſaying, come out thou naughty
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65665:25"/> and wicked heretique. I will now ſée, if thy God can deliver thée out of my hands. Francis ſaid, as the caſe ſtands it might eaſily be effected; If I were minded to eſcape away now, as I was heretofore, I could eaſily doe it, but I will not; for God hath called me to ſuffer, and not to flie away, and therefore I will not reſiſt, but rather obey his will.</p>
               <p>The drunkard hearing him ſpeake with ſuch mildnes, and moderation, and ſéeing that he would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> not come forth, being provoked thereto by him, in his fury he tooke up his ſtoole on which he ſat, and laid at him therewith, ſo as he had felled him to the ground, if the ſervant had not ſtepped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene, who tooke it out of his Maſters hands by force: yet was the poore priſoner very ſorely hurt, and lay long in the Chirurgions hands before his head could bée healed. But to make him amends, this cruell jaylour dieted him ſo ſtrictly both for meate and drinke, that hée had died with hunger, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> had not God inclined the heart of his ſervant now and then, to relieve him, by conveying meate to him in ſecret.</p>
               <p>After the Lord had thus by ſundry trials proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the patience and conſtancy of this his good ſervant, the Magiſtrates of the City of Aloſt conſulted how to put him to death, having oft cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Executioner to this their conſultation; but they could not agrée in the manner how to effect it. Some were of opinion it were beſt to have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> him put to death ſecretly in the priſon; others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to execute him openly, leſt they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the blot of being murderers. In the end waxing more hardy, having long detained him in bonds, they called him forth into judgment, and pronounced ſentence upon him, which was, that becauſe he had done contrary to the Kings Lawes, in returning againe to the City from which he was baniſhed, he had therefore deſerved to die, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo hée held certaine opinions directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>Francis hearing his ſentence read, without any ſhew of diſtemper, ſaid, <hi>Now ſeeing you are ſo thirſty after bloud, I willingly yeeld it into your hands, and my ſoule into the hands of my mercifull Lord God Almighty.</hi> Francis, ſaid they, we command you to hold your peace; for if you will not, wée will take order to bridle your tongue. Hée then promiſed them to obey their command. As hée went to ſuffer hée uſed that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſpéech of the Apoſtle ſaint Peter, I muſt now ſhortly put off this my earthly tabernacle, which <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14.</note> the love of Chriſt Ieſus my Lord conſtraines me to doe. Being come into the market place where he was to be offered up a ſacrifice, he knéeled downe; and having ended his prayer, he ſayed to the executioner, doe now what you are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the will of God bée done: and ſo preſenting himſelfe chéerefully to the ſtroke of death, he was beheaded the firſt of May, in the yéere 1566. his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> body being afterwards expoſed to the foules of the aire for a prey.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold here how God meant to awaken the men of this time out of their bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> ſecurity, as it were with a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der clap from heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis young man a maker of Tapiſtry about the age of two and twenty yéeres, the ſon of one called Simeon Tuſcaen dwelling in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of Andenard, was trained up from his youth in all godly nurtrature. He hearing news that things went more aukly to paſſe in Bruxels then hée could have wiſhed, determined in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to make it knowne by the effect, that the adoring of a breaden God, which the Roman Church ſo much worſhipped, was nothing elſe but an abhominable and execrable ſacriledge. Having caſt to and fro in his minde, and thoughts, the weightineſſe of the buſines he was to undertake, at length hée determined to demonſtrate the ſame more fully and apparently in a publike aſſembly, which was the thirtieth day of May in the ſaid yeare 1566. (which after the cuſtome of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts is called the feaſt of God, or Corpus Chriſti day.) Now by reaſon that two Cities of Andenard and Pamelle are joyned as it were in one, there were two Temples dedicated there, not to the Lord, but the one to ſaint Walburgne, called the Church of Andenard, and the other to their Lady, which is within the juriſdiction of the Lord of Pamelle.</p>
               <p>Iohn Tuſcaen directed his courſe towards this Church, to performe that which long before he had in his owne thoughts projected. Being come into the Quire of the Church in Pamelle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding there a multitude of People utterly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged from the true worſhip of God, ready to fall downe and proſtitute themſelves before a breaden cake, forthwith (not caſting what ſhould be the iſſue) being urged thereto through a zeale of Gods glory, drew towards the Prieſt, while he was elevating and ſhewing the people that which they call the hoſt; and with great vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſnatched it out of his hands, caſt it to the ground, and brake it all to pieces, ſpeaking with a loud voice; ſée here, my Maſters, your goodly God, who you ſée is not able to helpe himſelfe, but is here broken all to pieces. How long, how long, O ye ſenſeleſſe Prieſts, will you thus defile the holy ſupper of the Lord? ſhall wee never ſée an end of your filthy Idolatries? If the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the holy ſcripture can nothing move you, yet at length be warned and admoniſhed by this preſent example, that there is not a jot of divinity in this bread, ſéeing it is ſubject to be thus han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled: will yee worſhip a dead Idoll, your ſelves being living men?</p>
               <p>At this ſo vehement and bold an exhortation, accompanied with ſuch conſtancy, all the people there preſent ſtood amazed and in ſuch an extaſie, (but yet withall ſuch a noiſe and buſtling through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ont the Church) that the Curate of the pariſh, who before was in ſome by-corner there, comming towards the Quire, met Tuſcaen, as hee was paſſing through the preaſe without any feare or let. The Curate ſaluted him, not knowing what he had done, much leſſe ſuſpecting that he was the cauſe of all that tumult and ſtirre; for he was his couſin. Howbeit Iohn would take no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his ſalutation, but began to reprove him for deluding and abuſing the poore ſilly people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their overſeer; for a day will come, ſaid he, in which you ſhall render an account to God for them. In the hearing of this, the Curate called upon the people to lay hold upon the ſaid Iohn Tuſcaen, as hee was going out of the Church faire and ſoftly. So that it had been eaſie for him to have quite himſelf out of their fingers, if he had but haſtned his pace a little, becauſe none offered to touch or apprehend him. The Curate ſeeing that, delaied not, but with all ſpeed got him to the under Bailiffe of Pamelle, by whoſe outcries and importunities the Bailiffe could doe no leſſe but goe with him to apprehend the great Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique. As they were making towards him, hee ſhewed no more ſemblance of eſcaping, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Then they tooke and impriſoned him without
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65665:26"/> any reſiſtance. Dinner being ended, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1567.</note> before the Magiſtrates of Pamelle to be examined in the preſence of the Curate: after they had enquired of him who they were that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and ſet him on to doe ſuch an outragious act unto the hoſt, they asked him what he held the bread in the Maſſe to be, and whether he did not beléeve it was the body of Chriſt: If, ſaith he, you conſider well what the Angell ſayd to the Apoſtles at his aſſumption. <hi>viz. Act.</hi> 1. 11. this ſame Ieſus, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> which is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as ye have ſéene him goe <note place="margin">Where Chriſt is to bee ſought.</note> into heaven; You may plainely diſcerne that we are not to ſéeke him here below.</p>
               <p>After many other queſtions and anſwers, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent againe to priſon, he was the ſecond time examined: and being asked whether he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe when he did it, or diſtracted? Hée anſwered, That he had done it, not raſhly, but upon mature deliberation. Béeing further demanded what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſhould move him to commit ſo hainous an act? If this, ſaith he, ſéemeth ſo ſtrange unto you, then I pray you tell me who moved Moſes to breake the Tables of ſtone written with the finger of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 19.</note> God? They perceiving that he ſecretly aimed at their Idolatrie, ſent him to priſon againe.</p>
               <p>The eighth of Iune he was brought betimes in the morning into the judgment Hall, to receive their ſentence which was to be pronounced againſt him; where two friers Minorites were purpoſely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſent to ſée if they could turne him from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy: to which purpoſe asking him, if he did not beleeve that God was included in the bread which is lifted up in the Maſſe? He anſwered them by another queſtion; namely, whether the Potter could make a pot? They ſayd yes, but what was that to the purpoſe? He asked them againe, if the pot could make a Potter? The good fathers, ſéeing whereabouts he went, forthwith left him. When he ſaw he had thus ſtopped their mouths, he than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> God.</p>
               <p>Then the Magiſtrates of the city went up into the judgement ſeat, and gave ſentence againſt him; which was, firſt to have that hand ſtricken off, with which he had taken the Hoſt out of the prieſts hands, and his body to bée burned to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, which afterward was to be ſcattered into the river.</p>
               <p>Hearing this ſentence hée was very joyfull, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> thanking his Iudges, and the Lord of Pamelle. But the Bailiffe of Audenard wiſhed him rather to aske forgiveneſſe of God and of the people, for the offence he had commited. If I have offended any (ſaid hée) I aske them forgiveneſſe. Then was he led forth to be executed; and as he went, he ſung in his own mother tongue the Lords praier with ſuch confidence, as argued the inward peace of his Conſcience, in dying in ſo good a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</p>
               <p>The tormentor willed him to ſtretch forth his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> arme that his hand might be cut off; which he did, ſuffering the ſame with ſuch a patience, as if hée had felt no paine. And then with his eyes lifted up to heaven, he ſaid, <hi>O Lord God, it is for the glory of thy name that I endure theſe things: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mee now with ſtrength from above, that I may finiſh this ſacrifice.</hi> Forthwith the fire was kindled, which made him at the firſt to ſhrinke a little; but by continuall and ardent prayer to God the violence of the torment was abated and aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> Now ſtanding in the middeſt of the flames, his body being in a manner halfe conſumed, hée ſhewed apparent ſignes unto the beholders of his invincible courage, by holding up as well as hée could, his armes on a light fire.</p>
               <p>Thus was this valiant Martyr handled in the preſence of multitudes; which cauſed many to cleave the rather to the Doctrine of the Goſpell, ſéeing him dye ſo conſtantly.

               </head>
               <p>IOhn Goris Chirurgion, borne in Audenard, travelling towards Gaud, was betrayed by two ſpies, who ſignified the ſame to the Bayliffe; himſelfe alſo going the ſame way whither Goris was travelling him. The Bailiffe, hirſting after the bloud of this poore innocent, rid on till hee had overtaken him, asking him whether hée went? I am going, ſaid Goris, to the Pariſh of Nazaret. And I purpoſe alſo, ſaid the Bayliffe, to goe thither, wee will beare you company. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſſed on thus a little way, the Bayliffe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelfe ſure of Goris, began to lay hands upon him. Goris ſéeing that leaped over a ditch, and got into a little wood. The wood was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſet with Countrey people; and being there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, he was carried to Audenard, as a ſhéep to the ſlaughter, where he was committed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. They layed many things to his charge, which they were not able to prove. Being examined the ſecond time upon divers articles, hee anſwered thereunto with ſuch wiſedome, that the Counſell admired how a man of ſo meane account could defend his cauſe in ſo good a manner. But after they came to queſtion with him concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, now I ſee, ſaith he, that you ſeek my bloud.</p>
               <p>The night following hee was overtaken with <note place="margin">By this we ſee that man ſtands not by his owne ſtrength.</note> ſuch an apprehenſion of the feare of death, that for ſaving his life hee was almoſt reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the truth.

Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, prayed God that he would not lay his death to their charge. Comming to the place where he was to be executed, caſting himſelfe downe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, he made his prayer to God; in which prayer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> albeit he ſought the Lord to forgive his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yet added he this withall; <hi>I am perſwaded, that God being a juſt Iudge will not leave their ſinne unpuniſhed.</hi> Which prediction fell out not long after; for the Bailife who apprehended him, &amp; rejoyced in ſtanding by whilſt the martyr was executed was not long after ſhot with a harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, whereof he preſently died like a wretch.</p>
               <p>After Goris was thus executed, they brought forth his fellow priſoner, called Ioris of Aſſchen; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> who the ſame day ſuffered the ſame kind of death, that is to ſay, he was hanged upon a gibbet, which death he endured for the name of Chriſt with like conſtancy as did the former.

               </p>
               <p>From theſe conſiderations I received no ſmall conſolation; and therefore, deare wife, rejoyce with me, I pray you, and bleſſe our good God for theſe his mercies towards me; for he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which is equall and right.

What Calvin hath taught conformable to the word of God, I am of the ſame minde with him: and whereas you call your Religion, the old Religion, and ours the new, it troubles me not at all, ſince the Father of lies hath long ſince forged the ſame, to diſgrace the truth, and to eſtabliſh and maintaine the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of falſhoods and abſurdities of your Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents which you hold. For example, becauſe Chriſt in giving his diſciples bread in the Sacrament, ſaid, <hi>This is my body,</hi> thence they would make us beléeve that the bread is become the body of Chriſt, as if the verbe <hi>eſt</hi> ſignified a change of the bread into another ſubſtance, which is found in no language whatſoever.</p>

                  <p>Sir, that which I ſay is manifeſt enough, and ſo that which you affirme of your formes cannot ſtand; for Chriſt ſaith not, Eat the formes, but, Eate, this is my body. Now wee cannot eate, unleſſe we gnaw with our teeth, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> bruiſing therewith that we eate. If you ſay that the bread, which is fleſh as you hold, is conveyed under the tongue, and gently ſwallowed, then I anſwer, This is not eating but ſwallowing: for, Can he be ſaid to eate, who being halfe pined with hunger ſwallowes his bread and meate withou chewing? Nay, he may rather be ſaid to devoure it. Moreover, if the bread, which as you affirme is fleſh, bée put into a mans mouth, and ſwallowed, then how will you anſwere that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> which Chriſt ſaid in Saint Mathew, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <note place="margin">

                  <p>Theſe words muſt be taken of our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary eating, which is caſt (ſaving your preſence) after it is eaten into the draught.</p>

                  <p>The formes are turned into it, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt is gone; but theſe things muſt not be too curiouſly examined.</p>

                  <p>This anſwer cannot ſtand: the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, which you call kindes, cannot be changed thereinto, it is the ſubſtance which is changed. But let us come to a more ſubſtantiall argument: you teach, That whoſoever receives this Bread, which you call fleſh, receives Ieſus Chriſt. How <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor</hi> 11. 27. 29.</note> is it then that Saint Paul ſaith, Hee that eateth and drinketh unworthily eats and drinks damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> to himſelfe, &amp;c.</p>

                  <speaker>Biſh.</speaker>
                  <p>This argument hath ſome weight in it; for thus you reaſon, hee that receives Chriſt doth therewithall receive eternall life; but by our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine all receive Chriſt in the ſacrament, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt needs have eternall life.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe it is true according to your minor propoſition, that they receive him: but I deny that all receive him unto life everlaſting; for if they receive not the fleſh by the holy Ghoſt, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits them nothing.</p>

                  <p>Sir, the place you alledge makes againſt you; for Chriſt there reproves his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for thinking they ſhould eate his fleſh after a carnall manner, as it appeares by the words following; for the words, ſaid hée, which I ſpeake to you are ſpirit and life. If then wee are ſo wiſe as to obſerve that the Sunne, ſending downe its ſubſtance on earth by the beames thereof, doth after a ſort cauſe the hearbes to ſpring forth and <note place="margin">Simile.</note> grow, ſhall not the influence of the ſpirit of Chriſt be of much more efficacy to bring us to the true participation of his fleſh and bloud?</p>

               <head>A ſhort narration of the life and death of theſe two valiant Champions of Chriſt, Guy de Brez, and Peregrin de La Grange, Miniſters and martyrs.</head>
               <p>NExt to the pure preaching of the word, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much commends thoſe whom the Lord culls out to give their lives for the ſame, as doth an holy and blameleſſe converſation, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued unto their happy departure out of this world. It remaines then in few words, that we ſet forth the converſations of theſe two holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, that thereby the mercies and graces of the Lord be ſtowed upon them may have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter luſtre.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:65665:29"/>
               <p>Guy de Brez borne in Mons in Hainault, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his younger yeares much addicted to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſuperſtitions, came by continually reading of the Scriptures to taſte the ſwéetnes of Chriſtian Religion; which knowledge brought forth no ſmal fruit in him in due ſeaſon: Yet ſo, as it could by no meanes be reliſhed or received by them of his Nation. Whereupon he departed from Mons, and having learned the art of painting Glaſſe, came to London whileſt good King Edward the ſixth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> raigned, who gave perſecuted ſtrangers leave to have harbour within his realme of England. After his abode there a while, and underſtanding that the preaching of the Goſpell obtained ſome entertainment in the Low-Countries, he went over to give his aſſiſtance to thoſe of his owne Country.</p>
               <p>The firſt fruits of his labours were moſt an end in beſtwong ſome exhortations in ſuch places where he found any willing to give him audience, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> though never ſo few in number.</p>
               <p>But above all he clave to them of the City of Liſle, becauſe he found there a great number of beléevers who deſired nothing more than to heare the Goſpell publiquely preached unto them. At that time began alſo an holy conflict <note n="*" place="margin">Againſt which this godly man publiſhed a learned confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in French, which booke I have in my hands.</note> againſt the peſtilent ſect of the Anabaptiſts, which as cockle mingled it ſelfe amongſt the good corne. In this city he continued untill the flock of Chriſt wer diſperſed by reaſon of perſecution, and then went <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> to Gaud, where hée wrote his booke called the <hi>Staffe of Faith,</hi> extracted out of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. After that béeing deſirous to profit more and more in the knowledg of ſuch things as were requiſite to be in a Miniſter of the Goſpell, hée travelled towards Lauſanna, and thence to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva, to furniſh himſelfe with the tongues; and thence withdrawing himſelfe into the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, hée there eſtabliſhed the churches of Liſle, Tournay, and of the Valencians; in which cities <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> God ſo proſpered his labours, that he was preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his divine providence, as it were in the middeſt of the fiery flames, from falling into the hands of his enemies. And not to ſtand longer in relating the paines and travels of this faithfull ſervant of Chriſt, not onely the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the ſaid country can teſtifie, but alſo theſe of Diex, Mondidier, and Amiens alſo, which hée was an happy inſtrument to ſupport, whileſt the cruell perſecutions in his owne Land would not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> permit him to continue his Office of teaching there.</p>
               <p>The Duke of Bovillon obtaining him drew him to his city of Sedan, where he alſo continued a while in publiſhing the glad tidings of ſalvation, untill the Church of Antwerpe began in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Auguſt 1576, to call him to be their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor. But he could not obtaine leave of thoſe of Sedan to depart from among them without a great deale of difficulty, becauſe they evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> foreſaw by the beginning of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Low-countries, into what a Sea of troublous tempeſts bée ſhould bée caſt: and yet perceiving how the heart of this holy man longed to be gone, to yéeld his aſſiſtance to thoſe of his own nation; at length they conſented to let him goe with them that requeſted to have his helpe. Now having ſtayed but a while there, the brethren determined to ſend him to his ancient Church of the Valencians, who received him with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> no little joy, in regard the Lord had formerly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned him to erect a Church there peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly.</p>
               <p>To come now to Peregrine de la Grange, hée <note place="margin">Peregrin de la Grange.</note> was borne in Chute nigh to Saint Marcellin in Daulphine. In the moneth of Iune in the yeare 1565 he was ſent from the Schooles of Geneva, at the requeſt and inſtance of the Valencians, to ſerve in the miniſtery among them. Such was <note place="margin">His meeke diſpoſition won him much reſpect.</note> his méeke and milde diſpoſition, that it won him much love and reſpect, and made his miniſtery to be ſo much the more acceptable in the eyes of all men. After the demoliſhing of Images in the City of the Valencians, two Churches were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by thoſe of the reformed Religion for the uſe of prayer, preaching the word, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments. Now the detaining of theſe Churches, the one of them being uſed by a ſtranger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> namely by the ſaid la Grange who was none of King Philips Subjects, being alſo againſt the Decrée of Margaretn then Regent of the Low-Countries, gave occaſion to Noicurin, as then principall Bayliffe of Hainault and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, not onely to fruſtrate and break all accords with the ſaid Valencians, but moreover to afflict and beſiege them extremely. During which ſiege, becauſe the ſupper of the Lord was adminiſtred in both the ſaid Churches, it did ſo much the more enkindle the rage of the enemy againſt them, ſo as when the city was taken, La Grange was the more cruelly uſed, as you ſhall reade when wee come to ſpeake of his death.</p>
               <p>The ſame adverſaries, who encountred Guy de Brez his companion, aſſailed him alſo; but he overcame them by the helpe of Gods holy Spirit, who gave them both ſuch power, as their enemies were not able to reſiſt.</p>
               <p>They were impriſoned the eleventh of Aprill, and on Saturday the laſt of May the Provoſt of the bands came into the priſon about thrée of the clocke in the morning, to give theſe two priſoners warning to prepare themſelves for death; for they were to die at ſixe or therabouts. Whereupon both of them began highly to magnifie God for his goodneſſe, and gave the Provoſt thankes for the good newes which he had brought them. Aſſoon as they were up and ready, Maſter Guy entred into the fore Court, bidding the reſt of the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners good morrow; and then teſtifying to them his joy, ſpake after this manner; <hi>Brethren I am this day to die for the doctrine of the Goſpell; and now, bleſſed be God, I joy and rejoyce therein; I had not thought that God would ever have done me this honour. I feele my ſelfe repleniſhed with joy more and more, from minute to minute, my God addeth new courage unto me, and my heart leapes for joy within me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then exhorting the priſoners to be of good chéer, he told them it was no hard matter to die, and ſo by way of acclamation alledged that place out of the Apocalips, <hi>O how happy are the dead that dye in the Lord; for they reſt from their labours, and their workes follow them!</hi> Hée further be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the priſoners to ſtand faſt in the doctrine of the ſonne of God, which he had taught them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowing it to bée the undoubted truth, which was mainteined <note n="*" place="margin">Which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes were formerly omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in regard that in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they were the ſame with thoſe of Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grin do la Grange.</note> by him before the Biſhop of Arres and many others.</p>
               <p>Beware you do nothing, ſaid he, againſt a good conſcience; for I foreſée that the enemies of the Goſpell will execute the utmoſt of their rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; thinking thereby to weaken our faith, that ſo they might turne you from the truth, and ſo cauſing you to doe ſuch things as ſhould bring diſhonor to the cauſe for which you are in bonds. Take heed therefore ye ſhrinke not; for if yée doe, you ſhall certainely féele ſuch an hell in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, as will never ceaſe to vex and torment you. O my brethren, how good a thing is it to nouriſh a good conſcience?</p>
               <p>One of the priſoners asking him whether hée had finiſhed a certaine work which he had begun, he anſwered, <hi>No; For now I muſt ceaſe to labour, becauſe I am paſſing along towards the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt: the time of my departing is at hand, I goe to reape that in heaven which I have ſowne</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:65665:29"/> 
                  <hi>on earth. I have fought a good fight, I am at the point of finiſhing up my courſe: from henceforth the Crowne of Glory is layd up for me, which the Lord the righteous Iudge ſhal give unto me.</hi> Me thinks (ſaid he with a joyfull and ſmiling countenance) that my ſpirit hath obtained wings to ſoare aloft into heaven, being invited this day to the mariage Supper of the Lambe.</p>
               <p>As he was ſpeaking, the Provoſt came in with bands into the Court, and putting off his hat ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> him. Maſter Guy bad him welcome, and gave him thanks againe for his good newes. The Provoſt replied, It grieveth me much that things ſhould be carried thus. To which Guy joyfully anſwered, I accept of you as of my good Friend, I love you with all mine heart. Then taking his leave of the priſoners he went into the little hall of the priſon.</p>
               <p>Soone after Peregrine de la Grange entred into the ſame Court, who as he carried himſelfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> comfortably during all the time of his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo then after his accuſtomed manner he hegan with an amiable countenance to chéere the priſoners, with bidding them good morrow; and then ſaid thus unto them; <hi>I am this day to die for the Truth, and then the heavenly Inheritance is prepared for mee: my name is written in the</hi>

                  <hi>Booke of life never to be blotted out; becauſe the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He proteſted alſo, That for his part he never <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> taught ought there but the pure Word of God; as for the doctrine of the Papiſts, it led ſoules, he ſaid, to perdition and deſtruction: and thence took occaſion to exhort the priſoners to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from it, and to cleave wholly to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell. Then leaving them he went into another roome, and called for a bruſh to bruſh his hat and cloake, cauſing his ſhooes to be blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; For now, ſaid he, I am bidden to the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Lambe, where I am to feaſt with him for ever and ever. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 
               </p>
               <p>Going thence, ſome of the priſoners came to him, and finding him ſitting in the entry of the priſon upon a bench, with bread and wine ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, which was brought him for his breake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, they asked him if he went to ſuffer with thoſe ſhackles on his héeles? <hi>I would I might</hi> (ſaid hée) <hi>yea, and that they would bury them with mee to, that they might manifeſt the inhumanity of my adverſaries.</hi> And as thoſe brethren comforted him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> he replyed, that he felt ſuch joy of the holy Ghoſt in his heart, that he could neither with mouth nor tongue expreſſe it; adding, <hi>That God ſhewed him a thouſand times more favour to take him after this manner out of this tranſitory life, than if he had let him die in his bed by ſickneſſe: for now</hi> ſaith he) <hi>I ſhall dye with enjoying the benefit of all the powers of my ſoule, praying the Lord to have mercy upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then every one taking his leave of him they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> retyred, and forthwith Guy and La Grange were led to the towne hall to receive the ſentence of death, namely to be hanged for tranſgreſſing the Kings commandement given at the Court of Bruxels. And ſo not medling at all with any of the points of Doctrine which they had preached, they eſpecially inſiſted upon the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, againſt an expreſſe charge given them to the contrary.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, La Grange being brought to the place of execution, and now upon the ladder, hée proteſted with a loud voice (notwithſtanding the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> noiſe which the ſoldiers kept about the gibbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then was Maſter Guy brought thither; who, knéeling downe to have made his prayer at the foot of the ladder, was not ſuffered to make an end; for lifting him up they made him by and by to aſcend the ladder. Being thereon he faſtned his féet in the rundles, exhorting the people to carry themſelves with all due reſpect towards the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, ſhewing how ſome had overſhot them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>Then Maſter Guy exhorted them to ſtand ſtedfaſt in the doctrine which he had taught them; avouching that it was the undoubted truth of God. He could not finiſh his ſpéech fully, becauſe the Commiſſioners gave a ſigne to the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner to haſten and make an end.</p>
               <p>He was no ſooner turned off the ladder, but there fell out ſuch a tumult among the ſouldiers, being in armes in the market place, that they ran up and downe the City, ſhooting off their pieces againſt ſuch as they met, ſhooting off their pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt ſuch as they met, as well Papiſts as others, yea killing one another in a grievous manner, ſo as ſome fell downe dead among many others that were wounded and hurt.

They enjoyed ſuch fréedome of conferring and ſcanning of the points of Religion there, that they came in a manner to make profeſſion thereof publiquely; ſo as many ſtrange nations came to take notice thereof. But the Father of lies obſerving this began to beſtirre himſelfe, by ſetting his Lieutenant on worke, who hath his ſeat at Rome, to diſturbe theſe good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings: for it came to paſſe, that whilſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of good Chriſtians flocked thither from other parts, in proceſſe of time ſuch a courſe was taken by Antichriſts ſupporters, that many of them were impriſoned, and afterward ſent thence to Rome.</p>
               <p>The reſt by a new found execution, never till then heard of, were caſt into the ſea, and drowned in the bottome of the ſame. The manner of it was thus: After they had received ſentence, an yron chaine was faſtened about their middle with a ſtone of great weight tyed thereto; and then were they laid upon a planke betwéene two wherries, which being come to the place appointed, the wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries parting aſunder, the Martyrs were forthwith drowned. Yet for all this many ceaſed not ſtill to aſſemble together in a place appointed for that purpoſe, to talke and diſcourſe of heavenly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yea, and to make ſome collections for reliefe of the poore; ſo as in the yeare 1566, the called to them a miniſter of the Goſpell, to eſtabliſh &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a church among them; having alſo the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord adminiſtred to them. But ſome falſe brethren créeping in, under pretence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſame profeſſion with them, betrayed them.</p>
               <p>Then began the Popiſh Inquiſition to be ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted there with the greateſt cruelty that might be, towards the maintenance whereof the Pope ſent every yeare a certaine ſumme of money to thoſe holy Fathers, to be diſtributed among ſuch as were appointed to be ſpies and revealers of ſuch ſecrets as they could come to the knowledge of. Thus were many caſt into the ſea and drowned;

He was queſtioned with as touching the power of the Pope, prayer to ſaints, and about Purgatory, He anſwered that the Popes power was from man, which the Romane Conſiſtory and certaine Princes had given him: but that God the Father had given Ieſus Chriſt to be the <note place="margin">

He further added, that he would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip nor pray to any other but to God only, as it is written.

                     <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 5.</note> as of thoſe who were the true branches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into the Vine Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Then as Spinola was returned into his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Francis Sega (whom he was ignorant of) waited his comming, holding a candle in his hand, and paſſing by with his Kéeéeper, ſaluted him by his name; whence it came to paſſe, that they two conferred together about the doctrine of the Goſpell. Now howſoever Sega differed from <note place="margin">The conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of one mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr puts life into another.</note> Spinola touching the number of ſacraments, yet he referred himſelfe to the judgement of the true Church of Chriſt in that behalfe. But after that he had learned that Spinola had conſtantly ſtood to the defence of the truth, he was very joyfull and much comforted, ſaying, That God had reſerved him for ſuch a time as this, to make him partaker with him of ſo great conſolation.</p>
               <p>Hée wrote conſolatory letters to Spinola, committing his writings into his hands, whereof ſome were preſerved, and the reſt loſt by the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe of a falſe brother. Upon the thrée and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth day of February, 1567. the Kéepers of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon told Sega that he was to die within one houre after the ſhutting in of the evening. At the hearing of which newes hée intreated Spinola to pray with him. After prayer, Sega telling him that his ſoule was heavy to the death; Spinola gave him this anſwer, <hi>Feare not, for it will not be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall feele thoſe joyes which ſhall endure for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being brought out of his darke dungeon, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the time limited, hée tooke his leave of Spinola and the reſt of the priſoners. As hée was entred into the boat, a certaine frier began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to returne into the right way. Sega anſwered, that he was already in the way of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and paſſing on he called upon the name of God. He ſéemed not to be much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the binding of his hands, but was a little amazed at the faſtening of his body to the chaine. Yet by and by taking unto him a Chriſtian reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, he tooke whatſoever they did unto him pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. Being laid upon the bourd or planke, hée
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65665:30"/> commended his ſoule into the hands of God, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1568.</note> and being left of the two boats (upon the edges whereof the planke was ſtayed) the one declining this way, and the other that way, he fell into his ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre the ſea, and died patiently.</p>
               <p>Spinola ſoone after was preſented the ſecond time before his Iudges, namely the tenth of March, where he reproved the Popes Legate with his clergy there preſent, as alſo the Lords of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice who ſat in judgement upon him, becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> to their conſciences they ſo perſecuted the truth of God, calling them the offſpring of the Phariſées, Caiphas, and the Gentiles, who now, <note place="margin">As he did the firſt time hee was conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before them.</note> laid he, kill Ieſus Chriſt in his members. The nine and twentieth of March following, hée was the third time brought before them, where they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him if he would not recant his errors. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that the Doctrine he maintained was not erroneous, but the very ſame truth which Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and his holy Apoſtles taught and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and for which all the Martyrs, as well of old time as now, have willingly layd downe their lives, and endured the paines of death.</p>
               <p>After all this, Spinola became ſo weake, that <note place="margin">Spinola be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note> he determined to ſtrike ſaile (as they ſay) and to apply himſelfe to the time; being brought herein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the advice of ſome, namely that he ſhould faine a giving of his conſent to what the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate required of him, by meanes whereof hée might eſcape their hands.

Wherefore on the ninth of Auguſt hée was brought againe before the ſame Iudges, where he openly confirmed the ſame.</p>
               <p>His Iudges ſaid, that he ſhould either be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or burned alive. Then on the thirtéenth of Ianuary 1566.

To which he gave them this anſwer, <hi>I am no heretique, but the ſervant of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> At which words the popes legate commanded him to hold his peace, telling him that he lied. The next day in the morning (which was the laſt of Ianuary) he was brought into Saint Peters Chappell, where he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> becauſe he had béen a Prieſt; and the night following he was conducted unto the Sea, and there drowned in the place appointed; who died prayiſing and bleſſing God with invincible conſtancy.</p>

               <p>And that the Prince of Orange might make knowne to all, what injuſtice and cruelties were exerciſed upon thoſe of the Religion, he diſcovered the notorious ſubtilties of the cardinall of Gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la and others, who under the cloaks of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded catholique religion, ſought nothing elſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> but the diminiſhing of Gods glory, the Kings authority, and the welfare of the commonwealth, ſhedding the bloud of many a true Chriſtian, by whoſe death followed the loſſe of their temporall eſtates; and all, forſooth, under pretence of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>And for as much as tortures, vexations, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, executions both by fire and water, by ſtrait impriſonments, ſword, and gibbets did ſtill increaſe more and more; that for theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations the cauſe was lawfull and good, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon them the defence of ſo miſerable a people, to whom the Dutcheſſe of Parma, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe under his Majeſty, had expreſly permitted the preaching of the Goſpell, for preventing of the perils and dangers which threatened the ruine of the ſaid countries.</p>
               <p>And as the ſaid Prince had béen a faithfull and loyall ſervant to his Majeſty, in doing him many acceptable ſervices, without either ſparing his perſon or goods, ſo was he alſo ready preſt to be imployed ſtill in the like, more then at any time heretofore. And thus procéeding on further, hée made it apparant to every one whoſe judgement was not foreſtalled, that the Duke of Alva, who in reſpect of the dignities conferred upon him ought himſelfe to be a patterne and a protector of the Nobility and Gentry, had notwithſtanding put to death thréeſcore gentlemen, with others of quality, rich Burgemaſters of Bruxels, and of other Cities beſides; that this his ambition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riſen to a notable height of cruelty, durſt put to death the Illuſtrious Earles of Egmond and Horne, without any ſhew of law or equity, who had ſo faithfully ſerved the Emperour Charles of famous memory in his wars.</p>
               <p>Yea, that he might yet further debaſe the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Countrey, which is as it were the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſupport of his Majeſty; hée cauſed the heads of the ſaid Earles to be ſet upon poles and forkes; By ſuch ſpectacles charging upon their parents and friends much obloquy and diſgrace. Yea, this horrible execution did ſtrike ſuch a feare and terror into many, that to avoyd theſe oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they fled the countrey. For a concluſion he added, that all theſe things layd together, the iſſue thereof tended to the extirpation of all true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſequently the depriving of the faithfull not onely of their ſpirituall, but corporall good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. And therefore as a Prince, being a native member of the Empire, he held himſelfe obliged, in having compaſſion over the wrackes made among ſo many poore Chriſtians, to lend them his beſt helpe &amp; furtherance for the frée paſſage of the Goſpell, and the conſolation of ſuch of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties good Subjects, as were perſecuted, impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and oppreſſed.</p>
               <p>¶ Before wée ſhut up the Hiſtory of the yeare 1568. wée will adde to the former Martyrs ſome that were executed in the Low-countries at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times in the ſaid yeare, without tying our ſelves to any ſtrict order, touching their death.</p>

So paſſing by this houſe, and ſéeing the light of a candle in it, they imagined to méet with their prey there; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forcing the doore open, they tooke theſe two pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, together with their hoſt; God having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to be the witneſſes of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>So after they had béen detained in bands, they were all thrée condemned by the Magiſtrates to death, as heretiques. Giles was the firſt that they brought to the place of execution, and when ſhe Prieſts offered to put their Idoll into his hands, he refuſed it: whereat his adverſaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved cauſed him to be gagged, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might not heare him ſpeake ought to their edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Then was he burned, dying conſtantly and bleſſedly in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Forthwith the Sergeants were ſent to fetch his ſon out of priſon; who, being endued with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular fortitude and conſtancy, called to him one whoſe name was Iohn Camber, being the firſt man that laid hold on him at his apprehenſion, ſaying, I forgive thée my death: then preparing himſelfe to die in the Lord, the hangman cut off his head. Likewiſe Lovis Meulen, who having lodged theſe ſtrangers, according to the rule of the Apoſtle, was executed by the ſword, which death he willingly endured for the name of Chriſt in the yeare, 1568.</p>

               <p>THis woman was the widow of one Huges Moybert borne in Renay, about the age of ſixty yeares, one that truly feared God. The Magiſtrate of Renay impriſoned her in the yeare 1568. becauſe two yeares before ſhe with her children had conſented that a Miniſter ſhould preach in an outhouſe on the backſide of her dwelling; ſhe was alſo very charitable in relée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the poore, every way ſhewing forth the fruits of a true ſaving Faith. Having béen kept in priſon ſeven moneths, ſhe was condemned to die the nine and twentieth of Iuly. After her condemnation the Curate of Saint Martins came into the priſon, purpoſing to have heard her confeſſion. But the woman ſpake unto him with ſuch a divine grace, and with a ſpirit ſo reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with zeale, that the teares trickled downe his chéekes, and going his way he ſaid, I came to comfort you, but I have néed rather to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted of you.</p>
               <p>Then being brought by the Sergeants to the place of execution ſhe was beheaded; unto which ſhe yéelded her ſelfe with much boldneſſe and joy of heart, July the ninth.</p>
               <p>A ſtrange accident fell out upon the death of this woman; for a couſin of hers being with child, and ready to lie downe at the ſame time when this Martyr was going to be executed, hearing the ſound of the Bell (which uſually toules when any are to ſuffer) ſhe fell into a trembling, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo thrée wéekes, beyong her reckoning, her fruit ſtirring to and fro in her wombe as if a Weaver had moved his ſhuttle from one end of his Web to another; the neck of it bowing downe as if it had béen broken with ſome blow. By which it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that theſe cruell tyrants were the cauſe of this poore innocents death.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65665:32"/> his wéekes earnings. Now by reaſon of a friend of his that wrought with him, called Louys Stallens, God brought him into the right way. For the ſaid Louis would often tell him, that hée <note place="margin">The fruit of good counſell.</note> ought rather to diſtribute of his gettings to the Poore, than to ſpend them ſo waſtfully; for if he continued ſo, God would ſurely call him to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it. Theſe and the like exhortations ſo wrought upon this ſpendthrift, that he began to alter and change his courſe; ſo as in ſtead of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Tavernes, he became a diligent hearer of Sermons, and alſo gave himſelfe much to the ſtudy of the holy Scriptures: inſomuch that not long after he was called by the Church to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Deacon, the which he diſcharged careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully.</p>
               <p>Having occaſion to go to a place called Aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud, in the moneth March, 1567. to make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of certaine almes to the poore there, hée was arreſted and ſent priſoner to the Caſtle by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the Bailiffe, who had formerly ſéene him in the ſaid Abbats houſe. The Bailiffe asked him how he came now to turne heretique; for you learned not this (ſaid he) of your Maſter the Abbat. Nay Sir, ſaid Chriſtopher, I am no heretique, but a right beléeving Chriſtian; which he taught mée not indéed, but rather other vile qualities, the which I am aſhamed now to rehearſe.</p>
               <p>In priſon he had many diſputes touching mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, which he ſo defended and maintained <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> by the Word of God, that he put his adverſaries to ſlience.</p>
               <p>Some objecting againſt him his youth, being about the age of thirty yeares, he would tell them, that mans life conſiſted but of two dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> the day of his birth, and the day of his death, and therefore he muſt néeds die once: for my part therefore (ſaid he) I am now willing by death to paſſe into eternall life.</p>
               <p>Perceiving in the evening that he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to die the next day, the ſtriking off of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> bolts being a ſigne thereof, he ceaſed not to poure out his ſoule to God in prayer, untill ten of the clock, doing the like in the morning very early. His prayer being ended, he put on a cleane ſhirt, and waſhed himſelfe, ſaying to his fellow Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Brethren, I am now going to be married, I hope before noone to drinke of the wine of the kingdome of heaven. When he came downe he found thrée priſoners who were prepared to ſuffer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> with him; namely Io. Liebert, William Spiere, and a woman called Iannekin Bearts.</p>
               <p>Theſe foure exhorted one another, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged each other to ſuffer death conſtantly. Which done, a Fryer forthwith preſented himſelfe before them, comming as he ſaid to convert them. But Chriſtopher ſaid unto him, Away from us thou ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer of ſoules, for we have nothing to doe with thée. Whereupon he by and by departed. Then came in the hangman; who as he was buſie about <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> them to put into every one of their mouthes a gag, they bad one another farewell. Iohn Liebert ſaid, What, ſhall we not have liberty in this our laſt houre to praiſe God with our voice &amp; tongue? Chriſtopher anſwered, Brother, let not this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage <note place="margin">A confident ſpeech.</note> us; for the greater wrong our enemies thinke to doe unto us, the more aſſiſtance we ſhall finde from God: and ſo never ceaſed to comfort them till himſelfe was gagged alſo.</p>
               <p>Then the Executioner brought them to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> Towne houſe to heare their ſentence read; which in ſumme was this, That they ſhould be hanged becauſe they had béen preſent at the hearing of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.

               <p>The woman, being every way veriuouſly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, was condemned to be beheaded, becauſe ſhée had ſung Pſalmes, and made a certaine exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the word of God to her neighbours, at a womans up-ſitting. She was beheaded on the back ſide of the Townehouſe. Now becauſe her body was much enféebled, ſhe was cauſed to ſit upon a ſtoole, receiving thrée blowes with the ſword overthwart the téeth.

               <head>¶ <hi>Piere Coulogue, and Betken his Maid ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Martyrs, Anno 1568.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Peter Coulogue, by his Trade being a Goldſmith dwelling in Bzeda, had long ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Church there in the office of a Deacon; wherein he caried himſelfe with the good appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of all. His houſe alſo was frée for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to méet in, as oft as the exerciſes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion were performed amongſt them.</p>
               <p>But the enemies of the truth not enduring the ſwéet favour hereof impriſones him, and laid him in irons: which the faithfull there tooke very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily, uſing all the meanes they could to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to viſit him. But the enemies taking know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof cauſed him to be conveyed into the Caſtle; whence both his and the Churches ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was yet further encreaſed, becauſe they could not now come to be a comfort one to another.</p>
               <p>His ſervant Betken, being very zealous and well read in the Scriptures, brought him his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary dyet from day to day, never ceaſing to comfort and confirme him out of the Word of God. All which ſhe had liberty to do nine moneths together. At length they impriſoned her alſo: whereof ſhe was right glad, thinking her ſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to ſuffer ought for righteouſneſſ ſake. Not long after Peter was put to the torture; which after he had endured, they came in like manner to his maid ſervant Betken: who ſpake unto them after this maner, My maſters, wherefore will you put me to this torture, ſéeing I have no way of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended you? Is it for my faiths ſake? You néed not torment me for that; for as I was never aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make a confeſſion thereof, no more will I be now at this preſent before you; I willfréely ſhew you any minde therein. But for all this they procéeded on with that which they intended. Which ſhe perceiving ſaid, Alas my Maſters, it it be ſo that I muſt ſuffer this paine, then give me leave firſt to call upon God. To which her requeſt they yéelded. Now whileſt ſhe was making her prayer, one of the Commiſſioners was ſo ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with feare and terror that by and by he ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and could not be fetched again. And thus the poore maid eſcaped the torture.</p>
               <p>Soone after being examined touching her faith, they condemned theſe two innocents to be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now as they were led to be executed, great ſorrowings and complaints were heard among the people. But as for Peter and his Maid, they prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God with ardent affection, that he would perfect the good work which he had begun in them, and aſſiſt them with the power of his holy ſpirit, untill they had finiſhed their courſe.</p>
               <p>The courage and conſtancy of the ſaid Betken did ſo move many of the godly, both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that not caſting what perill or danger might enſue thereof, they brake through the multitude, embracing the Priſoners, and praiſing God for their conſtancy; ſaying, Fight manfully, for the crowne is ready prepared for you.</p>
               <p>After they were come where they ſhould ſuffer,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65665:33"/> Betken began to ſpeake unto the people with an <note place="margin">Anno 1568</note> amiable countenance, ſaying thus unto them. Brethren and ſiſters, be you alwaies obedient to the word of God, and feare not thoſe that can kill the body, for on the ſoule they can have no power: as for me, I am now going to méet my glorious Spouſe the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And then falling both downe upon their knées, they prayed to the Lord with great devotion. Being riſen up from prayer, the executioner laying hold of them bound <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> them with chaines to the ſtake, and then ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Peter, but would not ſtrangle the other, who encouraged her Maſter till he had yéelded up the ghoſt, and till the fire had taken hold of her ſelfe. Then was ſhe heard and ſéen to magnifie the Lord out of the middeſt of the flames; ſo as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among the multitude were raviſhed at her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible conſtancy. Thus did theſe two Martyrs of the Lord give up their laſt breath in the fire. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> May the 29. Anno 1568.</p>

               <p>IN. Flanders at a place called Vinderhout, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from Gand about a mile, there was a certaine Curate called Giles de Meyere whom it pleaſed. God illuminate with the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Goſpell. Now having received a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> from God, he would not hide it with the <hi>Evill ſervant;</hi> but ſought all meanes how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 18.</note> the ſame. He had the feare of God alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, manifeſting the ſame as well in his Doctrine as in his converſation, being carefull to inſtruct thoſe whom. God had committed to his charge. Yea, he went from houſe to houſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting <note place="margin">Acts 20. 20.</note> and exhorting every one, as occaſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, out of the word of God; above all, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them to beware of the abhominable ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> of the Papacy.</p>
               <p>He taught them that forgiveneſſe of ſins, the grace of God, and eternall life, was not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by our own merits, but by the frée and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grace of God in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Clergy of Gand having notice given them hereof, namely, that their Doctrine and authority would come to be little ſet by, if this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſhould procéed on thus in his courſe without let, they never reſted untill they had purſued him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> to the death. They impriſoned him then, in the moneth of March, anno 1567. caſting him into a déep and dark hole, where for a certaine ſpace hée remained, bearing this his affliction patiently, and conſtantly calling upon God night and day, praiſing him for eſtéeming him worthy to ſuffer for his ſake. In which his afflictions many good people, who came often to viſite him, received ſuch inſtruction, and conſolation from him, that they were hardly drawn to leave him, till of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> they muſt; their departure was alwayes accompanied with abundance of teares.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts and others of that rabble ceaſed not likewiſe to ply him with diſputations, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by that meanes to make him renounce his Faith; but to no purpoſe: for he remained ſtill firme and conſtant, kéeping himſelfe cloſe to the word of God written, which ſo vexed them, that they procured him to be laid in the Caſtle, where his ſentence was to be hanged; The Spaniards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> being then at Gand tooke him thence, bound him, girding and ſtraining him ſtrangely with cords, and would néeds have him burned. As he was led thither, they abuſed him ſhamefully with mockes, thruſting him forward, and ſtriking him cruelly. The Captaine of the band gave him a blow over the face with his Gantlet, which much disfigured him. Finally, theſe tyrants handled him worſe then any dog, only becauſe his patient and conſtant carriage of himſelfe tormented and enraged them.</p>
               <p>Being come to the place, they thruſt him into his little Cabbin piled up with fagots and wood, and then ſet fire unto him; where he was heard diſtinctly and plainly to uſe theſe words (albeit they had gagged him) Father into thy hands I commend my ſpirit.

               </head>
               <p>THis honourable perſonage, being come to the age of eighty yeares or thereabouts, uſed his houſe for the ſpace of fourtéene or fiftéene yeares as a Church, wherein the aſſembly in the City of Liſle commonly met. Being chaſed and baniſhed thence in the yeare 1561. he withdrew himſelf for a while to Tournay, whence he was conſtrained to flie, and to goe to Amiens and Moundedier Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Picardy, that there he might enjoy the pure preaching of the Goſpell. Afterward return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his owne countrey, he came to reſide in the City of Antwerpe, where after he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued many yeares, he was at length impriſoned and condenmed to be burned with two others, who ſuffered for the ſame cauſe. But it pleaſed God ſo to diſpoſe of him, that he dyed another kinde of death, to ſhew that his choſen ſervants have to triumph over the ſame, ſome one way, and ſome another. For being plunged into a ciſterne or tub full of water, he was drowned in priſon, and then they carried his body out of the City to a place called Berken, where the dead bodies of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned are laid upon the whéels or crutch. Among many letters which he wrote during the time of his impriſonment, my author hath ſelected out this one, which here followeth.</p>
               <p>DE are brethren and ſiſters in Ieſus Chriſt, I moſt humbly thank my good God that he hath ſo fortified and comforted me by his grace, that I féele my ſelfe more cheared by lying in this darke priſon, then if I were walking in the open ſtréets or fields. I ſay, this I féele according to the ſpirit; for as touching the fleſh what doth it apprehend here but ſtinking vapors and ſmoke?</p>
               <p>Wherefore my beloved, if it ſo fall out that you be apprehended for the name of Ieſus Chriſt, feare not the priſon, nor thoſe that have power to kill the body; for having done that, they can goe no further. Be yée not afraid then, ſéeing it is the reward which our good Captaine Ieſus Chriſt hath promiſed to all his faithfull ſoldiers and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. He who turnes his backe in this conflict goes by the loſſe; but whoſoever fights manfully obtaines in the end the crowne, not a crowne of gold, but of glory immortall. We here lay downe <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 10.</note> a fading life, filled with griefes and troubles, to change the ſome for a life everlaſting; we put off the ragges of this mortall fleſh, to be clothed with robes immortall; we forſake a loathſome life for joy and felicity eternall; ought any gaine or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to be compared with this? O ſwéet and happy Martyrdome, how doſt thou dignifie and enrich us, in deſpite of the world, devill, and our owne fleſh? And which of us now can complaine,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65665:33"/> ſéeing our Soveraigne Lord and Maſter hath <note place="margin">Anno 1569.</note> ſo expreſſely foretold it to all his followers? will any man come after me, ſaith he?

Let us beare, Oh let us then beare the croſſe chéerefully and with ioyfulneſſe, that we may be received in the preſence of his heavenly Father: for it is not only <note place="margin">Phil. 1 21. 1 Tim. 2. 12.</note> given us to beleeve in Chriſt, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake; and if we ſuffer with him, then wée ſhall alſo raigne with him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
               </p>
               <p>Oh that wée could admire his bounty, who no ſooner imployes us in his worke, but hath the wages ready in his hand wherewith to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence <note place="margin">Iohn 16. 20.

               <p>This good Queene, before ſhe could be drawn to come to Paris to ſolemniſe the mariage of her ſon the Prince of Navarre with the ſiſter of Charles the ninth then King of France, received letters upon letters from the ſaid King to accompany <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the Prince her ſon in that ſolemnity: now, wheras ſhe caſt ſome doubts touching her ſonnes mariage with one of another religion, the King aſſured her that all things ſhould be ſo wrought, as ſhould give her good ſatisfaction and content; promiſing that he would get a diſpenſation from the Pope <note place="margin">Pope Pius whileſt he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved could by no means en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to heare of, or give his co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to this mariage: but he died, &amp; then way was made for this mariage to bee concluded.</note> to that end. But when the Quéen underſtood that the King was minded to have this marriage ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenmized at Paris, ſhe would by no means heare of it: for I will not, ſaid, ſhe, put any confidence in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> that ſo mutinous a people, being the ſworne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies both of my ſelfe and mind.</p>
               <p>Still the King perſiſted in his ſute for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the ſame at her hands. Alſo having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence by ſome of his agents, that the quéen of Navarre began a little to waver, he ſollicited her yet once againe to come, aſſuring her that all things ſhould be caried in ſuch peaceable ſort, that ſhe ſhould have no cauſe to complaine. At length the Quéene came from Rochell to Bloyes in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> moneth of March, 1572. with great attendance, where it is incredible to thinke what welcome ſhe had on all ſides, eſpecially from the King &amp; his brethren, &amp;c. who yet, when all was done, could ſay to his Mother, Now Madam, have I not quit my ſelfe well? Let me alone, and I will bring them all into the net.</p>
               <p>In Aprill following were the Articles conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded concerning the mariage of the Prince of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre with the Kings ſiſter. In the beginning of May the King wooes the Quéene of Navarre <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> again to come to Paris for preparing of things fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for this mariage; which ſhe accordingly yéelded unto, and parting from Bloyes on the ſixth of the ſaid moneth, came to Paris on the fifteenth of the ſame. After which ſhe went from place to place in the City into ſundry houſes and ſhops, to finde out ſuch things as might tend to the adorning of the day of ſo great a ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>The que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ene mother could by no means brooke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> this good Quéene; and therefore not finding with what colour ſhe could diſpatch her with the reſt, and yet fearing the height of her ſpirit if ſhée ſhould ſurvive, as alſo that ſhe could not then ſo worke upon the flexibility of the Prince her ſonne as ſhe intended, ſhe conſulted with one Rene, whoſe practiſe it was to impoyſon things; who by ſuch meanes adventured to poyſon the Prince of Conde by the ſent of a poyſoned apple, which upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> ſome ſuſpition was firſt tryed upon a dog: and it had almoſt coſt the Princes chirurgion his life, by ſmelling too nigh thereto. This Rene, ſelling to the Quéen of Navarre his perfumed drugs, found the way how to poyſon her therewith, although others thought the contrary. But the ſaid Rene was heard afterwards to make his brags, that hée had the like in ſtore for two or thrée more, who ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no ſuch matter.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday the fourth of Iune, the Quéen fell ſick of a continuall Fever, and kept her bed; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> which procéeded, as it was given out, from the griefe ſhe had in her lights, wherein by long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance was bred an impoſthume, ſhe being alſo diſtempered with the heat of the ſeaſon and her extraordinary journeyes. This burning Fever grew ſo ſtrong upon her, that within five daies after ſhe died, to the great griefe of the better ſort, but to the joy of the ſecret counſell.</p>
               <p>The malady indéed was in her braine, which was not ſearched: in which the Quéen Mother had an hand, though ſhe ſéemed much to mourne for the affliction of her good friend. Now foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as in the time of her ſickneſſe ſhe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted with what ſpirit ſhe was guided, we will here ſet downe the true narration of her behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, both in the ſame her ſickneſſe, and alſo at her death.</p>
               <p>Perceiving in her ſelfe by the ſtrength of the diſeaſe (howſoever others ſleighted it) that ſhée could not long continue, ſhe made her ſelfe ready to receive from the hand of God that which he had appointed concerning her; and to that end reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſhe might have ſuch nigh about her, as might comfort her in this caſe out of the word of God, as alſo to pray with her and for her, according to that which Saint Iames ſaith, <hi>Is any ſicke among you,</hi>

               <p>Thus according to her deſire a Miniſter reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto her ſhewed out of the Scriptures, that Chriſtians ought in all things to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the will of God, as to the Father of ſpirits, <note place="margin">Heb. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> that they might live. And albeit the rigor of his chaſtiſements doth ſomtimes ſéem to our fleſh as if they were ſent to none other end but for our ruine and deſtruction; yet ought we to conſider, that becauſe he is juſt he can do nothing but juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and being a father, he cannot but therein ſéeke the welfare of his afflicted children.</p>
               <p>To which ſhe replyed, I take all this, ſaith ſhe, as ſent from the hand of God my moſt mercifull Father; nor have I during this extremity feared to die, much leſſe murmured againſt him for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting the ſame upon me: knowing that what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he doth, he doth the ſame ſo, as all in the end ſhall turne to my everlaſting good.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter continuing in his ſpéech, added, That the cauſes of ſickneſſes and diſeaſes muſt be ſought beyond the courſe of phyſiyke, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lookes to the corruption of the humours, or to the more noble parts of the body any way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered: for howſoever it was not amiſſe to have reſpect to theſe things as to ſecond cauſes, yet ought we to aſcend higher, namely to the firſt, even to God himſelf, who diſpoſeth of all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as it pleaſeth him. He it is <hi>That make the</hi>

                  <hi>wound and heales, that kils and makes alive.</hi> And therefore to him we ought to direct our prayers for comfort in all our griefes and ſufferings, and in the end for full deliverance; ſéeing it is no hard matter with him to reſtore health unto us, if his good pleaſure be ſuch.</p>
               <p>To this ſhe anſwered, that ſhe depended whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Gods providence, knowing that all things are wiſely diſpoſed by him, and therefore be ſought him to furniſh her with all ſuch graces as he ſaw to be neceſſary for her ſalvation. As for this life, ſaid ſhe, I am in a manner we aned from the love of it, in regard of the afflictions which have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from my youth hitherto, but eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot live without daily offending my good God, with whom I deſire to be with all my heart.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter told her, that long life, how ful of troubles ſoever it were, was notwithſtanding to be eſteemed among the bleſſings of God, ſeeing <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 16.</note> his promiſe implyes ſo much; and not onely ſo, but becauſe our life may many wayes ſerve to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and is both an honor and a pledge of his favor, even as it is to him whom his prince imploys long in his ſervice having had experience of his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for many yeares together. In which reſpect ſhe was earneſtly requeſted to pray, that if it were
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65665:34"/> the will of God to imploy her yet longer in his <note place="margin">Anno 1566.</note> ſervice, for the further inlargement of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, that he would grant unto her ſuch recovery of health, and good diſpoſition of body, that with renued ſtrength ſhée might bee encouraged to finiſh her courſe much more nobly than hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Whereupon ſhe proteſted, that in regard of her owne particular her life was not dear unto her, ſéeing ſo long as ſhe lived in this fraile fleſh, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſhe was ſtill prone and apt to ſinne againſt God: onely, ſhe ſaid, her care was ſomewhat for her Children (which God had given her) in reſpect they ſhould be ſo ſoone deprived of her now in their young yeares; yet not doubting, ſaid ſhe, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſhould pleaſe God to take me from them that himſelfe will be a Father and a protector over them, as he hath béen to me in my greateſt afflictions; and therefore I commit them wholly to his government and fatherly care: theſe were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> her very words.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter ſaid, that he bleſſed God to ſée in her Majeſty this aſſurance of faith, and ſo to caſt her care upon the providence of God, praying her ſtill to perſevere therein, which would ſufficiently ſeale unto her truth of her faith. And thus, ſaid, he, did the Patriarkes in times paſT commit the care of their poſterity over into the hands of <note place="margin">Gen. 24 1. Gen. 27. &amp; 48. 15. &amp; 49.</note> God; as may appeare by Abraham, Iſaac, and Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, touching their ſeverall bleſſings.</p>
               <p>But yet is was very requiſite, as he ſaid, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſhe ſhould make choiſe of ſuch, who, for their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity both in life and doctrine, might continue to water in theſe young Princely plants the ſéeds of piety, which had béen ſowne in them by her ſo great paine and induſtry, ſéeing it was to bée hoped, that the example of her faith and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the ſervice of God, which ſhe had ſet before them, would ſerve as a perpetuall inducement to imitate her ſo noble vertues.</p>
               <p>Now whereas ſhe had againe declared that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> death was not terrible unto her, becauſe it was the way by which we paſſe hence to our eternall reſt; The Miniſter told her, that Chriſtians had little cauſe to feare death, in regard they ſhould <note place="margin">Becauſe by death we paſſe to life. Iohn 8. 51, 52. Iohn 11. 26. Iohn 11. 13, 14. Acts 7. 60. 1 Cor. 15. 55.</note> not die at all, according to Chriſts, words in the Goſpell of Iohn, he that liveth and beléeveth in me ſhall never die. For death (to ſpeake properly) is no death to them, but <hi>a ſleep;</hi> being often ſo called in the Scriptures; and therefore Chriſt for their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſakes hath overcome and triumphed over it in his owne perſon. So as now we may cry out with ſaint Paul, <hi>O death where is thy ſting? O grave where is thy victory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She was often admoniſhed by him to make confeſſion of her ſinnes before God, ſhewing that bodily diſeaſes tended to the diſſolution of nature, and that <hi>death was the wages of ſinne;</hi> declaring <note place="margin">Rom 6. 23.</note> moreover that by this her chaſtiſement ſhe might diſcerne what ſhe had deſerved, if God ſhould now enter into iudgement with her, not onely in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> regard <hi>of the fall of our firſt Parents,</hi> in which guilt <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> ſhe was enwrapped, as well as others, but alſo by her owne perſonall ſinnes, ſéeing the beſt of men or women in the world are in themſelves but poore, miſerable and wretched offendors: yea, if the Lord ſhould puniſh us according to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits, we could expect nothing at his hands but eternall death and condemnation.</p>
               <p>At theſe words, ſhe began with her hands and eies lifted up to heaven, to acknowledge, that her <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> ſinnes which ſhe had committed againſt the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> were innumerable, and therefore more then ſhe was able to reckon up: But yet ſhe hoped that God for Chriſts ſake, in whom ſhe put her whole affiance, would be mercifull unto her.</p>
               <p>From the later clauſe of her ſpéech the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter tooke occaſion to declare at large upon what ground ſhe was to expect the fruit of this mercy of God in Chriſt; ſéeing <hi>the whole have no need</hi>

                  <hi>of Phiſitian, but they that are ſicke:</hi> and therfore Chriſt ſaith in that place, <hi>Hee came not to call the righteous, but ſinners unto repentance;</hi> And that he is ready <hi>to fill the hungry with good things,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 1. 53.</note> whereas in the meane while he ſends the rich empty away. Of all which, ſaid he, you ought ſo much the rather to be perſwaded in your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by how much the more the holy ſpirit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth to your ſpirit that you are the childe of God, <hi>Crying in you, Abba, Father.</hi> For what is <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15. What faith is.</note> faith elſe, but a firme truſt and aſſurance of the good will of God, manifeſted towards us in his bleſſed ſonne?</p>
               <p>Now the Miniſter, fearing he might ſome way offend her by his overlong diſcourſe, held his peace; the rather becauſe the Phyſitians thought that a long continued ſpéech might bee hurtfull unto her; but ſhe on the contrary earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted him not to forbeare ſpeaking unto her about theſe matters of life and eternall ſalvation; adding, that ſhe wow felt the want of it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that ſince her comming to Paris ſhee had béen ſomewhat remiſſe in hearing ſuch exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of the word of God; And therefore I am now the more glad, ſaith ſhe, to receive comfort out of it in this my ſo great extremity.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter then endeavoured to ſet before her the happineſſe of heaven, and what thoſe joyes <note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 11.</note> were which the faithfull there poſſeſſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God: which when the ſcriptures intend to diſcover unto us, they onely tell us that the eie <note place="margin">1 Cor. 259.</note> hath not ſeene, nor hath the eare heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man, to conceive what theſe things are, which God hath prepared for them that love him. To which purpoſe he uſed this ſimllitude; as if a King, minding greatly to honor <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſome noble perſome noble perſonage, ſhould bring him to his court, and there ſhew him his ſtate and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, his Treaſures, with all his moſt precious Iewels: even ſo, ſaith he, will the Lord one day reveale to all his elect and faithfull people his magni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cence and glory, with all the treaſures of his Kingdome, after he hath gathered them home to himſelfe, decking and adorning them with light, incorruption and immortality.</p>
               <p>This happineſſ therefore being ſo great, her highneſſe, he ſaid, ought to be the leſſe carefull about the leaving of this tranſitory life, ſeeing that for an earthly kingdome, which ſhe was now to forgoe, ſhe ſhould inherit an heavenly; and for temporall good things, which vaniſh and come to nothing in the uſing, ſhe ſhould for even enjoy thoſe that were eterenall and everlaſting. For her faith being now firmely ſetled upon our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſhe might be ſuffered to obtaine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſalvation by him, on which words he tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to direct his ſpeech in more particualar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner unto her, ſaying:</p>
               <p>Madame, doe you verily beleeve that Ieſus Chriſt come into the world to ſave you? and doe you expect the full forgiveneſſe of all your ſinnes, by the ſhedding of his bloud for you?</p>
               <p>To which ſhe readily anſwered ſhe did; belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that he was her only Saviour and Mediator, looking for ſalvation from none other, knowing that he hath abundantly ſatisfied for the ſinnes of the whole world, and therefore was aſſured that God for his ſake, according to his gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in him, would have mercy upon her.</p>
               <p>Thus you have in part the goodly ſpeeches, which paſſed from this religious Lady in the beginning of her ſickneſſe; all which was within the ſpace of three or foure daies. Howſoever before that, and ſince alſo ſhe ceaſed not to continue the ſame her fruitfull and comfortable communications, now and then ſending forth moſt affectionate ſlighings
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65665:35"/> to God, as a teſtimony of that hope and deſire <note place="margin">Anno 1567.</note> ſhe had in enjoying his preſence; often uttering theſe words, <hi>O my God, in thy good time deliver me from this body of death, and from the miſeries of this preſent life, that I may no more offend thee, and that I may attain to that felicity which thou in thy Word haſt promiſed me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither did ſhe manifeſt her pious affection by theſe her words onely, but therewithall ſhewed a joyfull and reſolute countenance, as the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> of her ſickneſſe could beare: which gave ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proofe to all that beheld her, that the feare of death could not drive her from the ſtedfaſtneſſe of her Faith.</p>
               <p>When ſhe had finiſhed theſe her conſolatory ſpéeches, they uſually went to prayer; intreating the Lord that he would arme her with conſtant patience, and have mercy upon her.

               <head>¶ <hi>The Prayer.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>O Lord our God, we confeſſe hee before thy Divine Majeſty, that wee are altogether unworthy of thy infinite mercies, by reaſon of our manifold iniquities; and that we are ſo farre off from deſerving to be heard of thée in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> that we are rather worthie thou ſhouldeſt reject both our perſons and our ſutes; but ſéeing it hath pleaſed thée to make us a gracious promiſe of hearing and granting our requeſts, we humbly beſéech thee fréely to forgive all our offences, and to cover them under the obedience and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thy deare Sonne, that through him our ſelves and poore ſervices may be well pleaſing before thee. For Lord we acknowledge that all our afflictions are meaſured out unto us by thine hand, who art a moſt juſt Iudge, in regard we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> have every way provoked thee to wrath by our infinite ſinnings againſt thee; yea, by our rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which now teſtifie againſt us. For alas Lord, our life hath no way béen anſwerable to that perfect obedience which thou in thy holy Law juſtly requireſt at our hands, which we from day to day do tranſgreſſe; and therefore doe here caſt downe our ſelves at this time before thy glorious preſence, unfeignedly acknowledging our miſery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> and wretchedneſſe from the very bottome of our hearts.</p>
               <p>Yet Lord mercy is with thee, and becauſe thou art our father, therefore thou deſireſt not the death of ſinners, but rather that they ſhould convert and live. For this cauſe we now fall downe before the throne of thy grace, with confidence of obtaining thy wonted mercy, which thou haſt promiſed to ſuch as call upon thee in truth: beſéeching thee, which art the Father of mercies, to haue compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> on all ſuch whom thou haſt humbled under thy mighty hand, by any of thy rods and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but more eſpecially this thy ſervant the Quéene, who lieth here before thee ſicke of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſeaſe, that as thou haſt righteouſly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted her for her ſinnes (which ſhe alſo doth with us acknowledge) ſo it would pleaſe thee in pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them all unto her, for thy beloved ſone ſake, to grant that ſhe may profit by this thy correcting hand for the time to come. Above all, give her a ſwéet ſenſe, yea a full aſſurance of thy eternall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> loves, that ſo ſhe may with the greater patience take downe this bitter potion miniſtred unto her from thy hand, and that the ſole deſire of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy preſence may cauſe her to forget all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greatnes and magnificence; knowing that they are nothing in reſpect of the glory which is now ſet before her.</p>
               <p>Endure her alſo with méekeneſſe of minde to beare the tediouſneſſe of her affliction; for howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ſpirit be willing, yet the fleſh is weake, yea full of reſiſting and unbeliefe; that ſo recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things from thee as from as father; ſhe may the more willingly ſubmit her will unto thine.</p>
               <p>And becauſe, O good God, thou haſt made her hitherto an happy inſtrument for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy glory, and the defence of thy poore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted people; we pray thee, if it may ſtand with thy good pleaſure, reſtore her to health againe, that ſo the excellent work which thou haſt by her means begun may not be left unperfect, but by vertue of this her deliverance ſhe may with renewed forces undertake the ſame in better ſort than ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, eſpecially for the well educating and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up the children which thou haſt given her.</p>
               <p>But Lord, if thou have a purpoſe now to call her home to thy ſelfe, who are we that we ſhould contradict thy holy will? onely we pray thee that thou wouldſt confirme her more and more in the knowledge of thy bleſſed Goſpell, and thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the certainty of her ſalvation, which thou haſt given her by faith in thy ſonne Jeſus Chriſt, that thus ſhe may not ceaſe to ſanctifie and call upon thy holy name unto her laſt breath.</p>
               <p>And as touching our ſelves, who are here by thy good providence gathered together about her, being in bodily health, give us to know the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and brevity of our life: that ſo, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our duty, we may behold the ſame in this mirrour which thou haſt ſet before us; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that even the greateſt in the world are ſubject to the ſame calamities, as well as the ſmall; that ſo our chiefe care may be to imploy the remainder of our time to thy honor and ſervice: all which we cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e of thee in the name of Jeſus Chriſt thy ſon, our only Mediator and Advocate. Amen.</p>
               <p>Thus we have as néere as we could gathered the ſumme of the prayer. During which ſhe ceaſed not, with hands and eies ſtedfaſtly lifted up to heaven, to fetch many déep ſighes, eſpecially when mention was made of that mercy of God in Chriſt which he extendeth towards poore ſinners. So as there was not any there preſent that might not evidently perceive, that her heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were joyned to the prayer which we pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in her preſence.</p>
               <p>And while ſhe thus lay, ſhe ſtill continued in her godly reſolution to depart hence, that ſhee might be with Chriſt, taking great delight in the holy and Chriſtian exhortations which were uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made unto her by many godly and learned men, who came in to viſit her, to whom ſhee alſo manifeſted no ſmall teſtimony of that faith, and hope, which ſhe had in God, touching the ſalvation of her ſoule, by her holy and Chriſtian ſpéeches, which for brevities ſake are here omitted.</p>
               <p>Yea, albeit the Lord exerciſed her much with the ſenſe of her inward diſeaſe, yet could you not at any time diſcerne any ſpéech lavouring of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment, or impatience, to procéed out of her mouth; nay, ſca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſely a groane, which not only thoſe of her owne family, but many others can teſtifie, even the Quéene Mother, with others alſo, who now and then came in to ſee her.</p>
               <p>But if at any time ſhe felt any refreſhings from the violence of her diſeaſe (there being no malady ſo vehement which hath not ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and breathing time) ſhe manifeſted to all her willingneſſe to obtaine the recovery of her former health, refuſing to that end no good meanes preſcribed for her by the learned Phyſitians. Againe, when ſhe perceived her ſickneſſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe upon her, and that ſhe grew worſe and worſe, ſhe was no whit appalled thereat, but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65665:35"/> ſhewed her ſelfe to be armed with an invincible <note place="margin">Anno 1568.</note> conſtancy, to undergooe the utmoſt that death could doe againſt her, preparing her ſelfe willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that laſt conflict.</p>
               <p>Moreover ſéeing her Ladies and Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men wéeping about her bed, ſhe would forthwith rebuke them, ſaying, I pray you wéep not for me, foraſmuch as you ſée God doth now by this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe call me hence, to enjoy a better life, and to enter in at the deſired haven, towards which this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> fraile veſſel of mine hath for a long time béene ſtéering; only ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe ſomewhat grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ſhe lacked opportunity to reward them, and many more of her family and train which had done her faithful ſervice, as ſhe could have wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; excuſing her ſelfe with theſe words unto them, that it was not for want of good will, but by being overtaken and ſo prevented by this her unexpected ſickneſſe, But, ſaith ſhée, I will not faile to give order concerning the ſame to my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ability.</p>
               <p>In the end, féeling her ſtrength to decay more and more, ſhe gave order to have her laſt will and teſtament made, wherin ſhe above all wiſhed, that her children might have but the grace to honor and feare the Lord, exhorting them conſtantly to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the profeſſion of the Goſpell, in which they had béen trained up from their youth; ordaining eſpecially that her daughter the Princeſſe ſhould be educated and inſtructed therein, by the foure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Ladies which ſhe had appointed and brought with her out of Bearne for that end and purpoſe. And being come to age, her deſire was that ſhe might be joyned in marriage to ſome Prince of the ſame religion, by the counſell and advice of the Cardinall of Bourbon and Gaſper Count of Colligny Admirall of France, whom ſhe made Executors and overſéers of her ſaid Teſtament. But here it may not be omitted briefly to relate another conference which ſhe had with a Miniſter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> of the Goſpell before her departure.</p>
               <p>The eighth of Iune, which was the day before her death, ſhe cauſed a Miniſter of the Goſpel to be called for, and finding that ſhe was drawing nigher unto her end than before, ſhe willed him to ſpeake ſomewhat largely of ſuch temptations as Satan is wont to aſſaile Gods elect withall in their laſt conflict.</p>
               <p>To which the Miniſter anſwered, that then was the houre indéed wherein that ſworne enemy of all the faithfull did moſt buſily beſtir himſelfe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> if he could, to deprive them of the comfort of their ſalvation; not ſparing at that time eſpecially to ſet upon them with might and maine: but yet even then the Lord is not, nor will be wanting to his, filling their hearts with ſuch joy and comfort of the holy Ghoſt, as ſhall make them through the ſame more than conquerours.</p>
               <p>The firſt engine then which ſatan uſeth againſt the Saints to cauſe them to deſpaire, is to preſent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> before their eyes the innumerable heapes of their ſins and pollutions, wherewith they have any way béen defiled in their whole life; and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents unto them Gods juſtice, before which no fleſh can be able to ſubſiſt, unleſſe it be pure and ſpotleſſe: whence he infers, that miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners can expect and looke for nothing, but an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible deſolation and condemnation. But againſt theſe aſſaults in the firſt place muſt be oppoſed, (as David doth in the one and fiftieth Pſalme) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> the infinite multitudes of Gods compaſſions, which doe infinitely ſurpaſſe the multitudes of our ſins. And as touching the juſtice of God, we confeſſe that no creature that is defiled with ſin can in any ſort abide to be ſtrictly examined by it, if he ſhall call the ſame to a ſevere account: but we alſo know that God will never enter into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with thoſe that beléeve in his ſon, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes unto them that righteouſneſſe and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which was accompliſhed in him, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficient for us, being imputed unto us, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt the judgement of God: therefore in it alone they expect to ſtand before his face, and not by their owne dignity or worthineſſe. Indéed if they were to appeare before the throne of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to receive thence what they have deſerved, they had good reaſon to be overwhelmed in utter deſpaire, as off as they thinke upon or looke on the ſame: but turning their eyes upon him, who being the eternall Son of God hath clothed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with our humane nature, to beare in the ſame the puniſhment due to our ſins, and therein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted us, then Gods juſtice doth no way affright us, but rather yéelds us aſſured comfort, becauſe they make this their full reſolution, that foraſmuch as God is juſt, he cannot require the ſame debt twice. Having therefore received full and perfect ſatisfaction of him, whom he hath ordained to be our ſurety, and paid our debts for us, thence we gather aſſurance that he wil no more require them of us.</p>
               <p>To which purpoſe theſe ſentences are to be well obſerved. It is Chriſt who hath borne our griefes and carried our ſorrows. That the chaſtiſement <note place="margin">Iſa. 53 4. 5.</note> of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed. That we all like ſhéep have gone aſtray, and have turned every one to his owne way, and the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all. Chriſt is our peace and the propitiation for our ſins. The Lambe of God which taketh <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 14. 1 Iohn 2. 2. Iohn 1. 29.</note> away the ſins of the world. Theſe with many the like ſentences the Miniſter propounded by way of anſwer to this vertuous Ladies demand: concluding the ſame thus, that Gods juſtice ought not to terrifie thoſe that beleeve in Chriſt, of whoſe <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> righteouſnes and redemption they are partakers, knowing that Ieſus Chriſt who knew no ſinne was made ſin (that is to ſay, an oblation for ſin) <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</p>
               <p>I grant, ſaith he, that theſe things belong not to all indifferently, but only to ſuch as beléeving in the Son of God doe wholly reſt themſelves ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the merit of his death and paſſion, which <note place="margin">Acts 4 12:</note> merit of his, as Saint Peter witneſſeth, ſufficeth for their ſalvation.</p>
               <p>After theſe matters premiſed, he asked her whether ſhe placed whole confidence on Chriſt crucified, who dyed for her ſins, and roſe againe for <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 25.</note> her juſtification?</p>
               <p>To which the noble Princeſſe anſwered, that ſhe neither expected ſalvation, righteouſneſſe, nor life from any elſe, then from her only Saviour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, being aſſured that his only merit abundantly ſufficed for the full ſatisfaction of all her ſins, albeit they were innumerable.</p>
               <p>This being your Faith Madam (ſaid the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter) you cannot come into condemnation, but <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 24.</note> are paſſed from death to life. Then taking an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion again to reſume her former ſpéech, that ſhe had no cauſe to be afraid of Gods Throne of <note place="margin">Heb. 4 16.</note> Iuſtice, ſéeing it was turned into a Throne of Grace and Mercy unto her, and that the houre of death ſhould now be excéedingly welcome to her, ſéeing it could be nothing elſe but a ſwéet paſſage into a far better life, as alſo the time in which all <note place="margin">Phil 1. 23. Rev. 21. 4.</note> feares ſhould be wiped away from her eyes: He likewiſe ſhewed that ſhe ſhould doe well continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be thinking on that excellent ſentence, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, becauſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>from thenceforth they reſt from their labours, and their workes follow them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For then, ſaid he, the time approacheth wherein ſhe ſhould enjoy the viſible preſence and ſociety of her husband Chriſt, and have fellowſhip with the bleſſed Angels, and celeſtiall ſpirits, with the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65665:36"/> holy Patriarkes, Prophets, Apoſtles and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs <note place="margin">Anno 1572.</note> of the Son of God, to partake with them of the ſame felicity and glory.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter minding yet further to ſound her, whether ſhe were loth to leave this life, uſed theſe words: And now good Madam, ſaid he, if it ſhould pleaſe God by this your ſickneſſe to put an end to this weariſome pilgrimage of yours, where yet you remaine with us, and to call you home to himſelfe, whereof he gives us to ſée ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> evident ſignes and tokens, are you willing, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéech you, to goe unto him? To which this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Princeſſe with great magnanunity and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, without any aſtoniſhment, replyed, Yes, I aſſure you.</p>
               <p>Then he once againe added, good Madam, open the eyes of your Faith, and behold Ieſus your great Redéemer ſitting at the right hand of his Father, reaching out his hand to receive you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Are you, are you willing to goe unto him? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Yes, I aſſure, you, ſaith ſhe, moſt willing, and much more willing than to linger here below in this world, where I ſee nothing but vanity.</p>
               <p>The miniſter, not willing to continue longer in this kinde of diſcourſe, asked if ſhe were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that they ſhould goe to prayer, declaring that godly perſonages there preſent would willingly joyne their deſires with hers. To which ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, the ſaid Miniſter prayed by her a good ſpace, whileſt this pious Lady manifeſted her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ardent affection to call upon God.</p>
               <p>When prayer was ended, the Miniſter diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in her the undoubted teſtimonies of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and of the ſorrow ſhe conceived for the offences which ſhe had committed againſt God, together with the aſſured confidence which ſhée had in his mercies, as a Miniſter of the Goſpell, amd Embaſſadour of the Son of God, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority diſpenſed to him, having committed to him the word of reconciliation, he aſſured her in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> his name, that all her ſins were forgiven her of <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> God, and that they ſhould never come into account before his judgement Seat; yea, that ſhe ſhould no more dount thereof, then if the Sonne of God from heaven ſhould ſay unto her, <hi>Daughter thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> And to the end that troubled conſciences might the better be quieted, Chriſt hath uſed theſe words, ſpeaking to his Miniſters, ſaying, <hi>Whoſe ſoever ſins ye remit, they are remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>and whoſe ſins ye unlooſe, they are unlooſed.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> The reaſon is, becauſe the word which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce is not the word of a mortall man, but of the immortall God, being of no leſſe weight, than if himſelfe uttered the ſame.</p>
               <p>Then he asked of her Majeſty, if he accepted of ſo gracious a Meſſage which aſſured her of the frée pardon of all her ſins. Yea, I doe, ſaith ſhee, and make no doubt thereof.</p>
               <p>Not long after theſe exhortations, the Admirall comming in, and with him another Miniſter, ſhée <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> alſo gave care to him for a good ſpace together; whoſe diſcourſe tended to prepare her for death, as he had done who had ſpoken to her immediatly before; who having finiſhed his ſpéech prayed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with her and for her, which ſhe heard with great attention and affection. Then ſhe requeſted that theſe two miniſters might ſtay with her all night in her Chamber, and that they would in no wiſe leave her.</p>
               <p>The greater part of this night was ſpent in holy admonitions which theſe two miniſters gave <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> to this gracious Lady and Princeſſe one after another. Beſides theſe admonitions ſhe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that ſome Chapters of the holy Scripture, which were pertinent for her condition, ſhould be read unto her; one of the Miniſters read in her hearing certaine Chapters out of the Goſpell of Saint Iohn, namely, from the fouretéenth to the ſeventéenth. After he had read to her theſe Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he went to prayer, which being ended the Quéene deſired to take ſome reſt; but it was not long ere ſhe commanded them to reade again: whereupon the other Miniſter having made choiſe of certaine Pſalmes of David, full of ardent and affectionate prayers, ſuiting to this Princeſſes preſent affliction, he read them unto her, and for a concluſion read the one and thirtieth Pſalme, <note place="margin">Pſal. 31. 5.</note> where the Prophet, among other things, doth there commend his ſpirit into the hands of God; becauſe, ſaith he, thou haſt redéemed me, O Lord God of truth.</p>
               <p>The Quéene willed them to pray with her again: and thus, as I have ſaid, was the moſt part of the night ſpent in ſuch vertuous exerciſes, namely in exhortation, in reading the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in prayer: during all which time the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters never diſcerned in any of her ſpéeches or behaviour the leaſt impatiency, Nay, whereas ſome dayes before ſhe fell ſick ſhe ſhewed how af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately ſhe was bent to provide things moſt magnificent for the day of her Sons marriage, according as the State of ſo great an alliance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: it was admirable to obſerve, that after th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s ſickneſſe had ſeized upon her, God wrought in her ſuch aforgetfulneſſe and neglect of all ſuch matters, that ſhe never made ſhew of having ſo much as a thought thereof.</p>
               <p>This night being thus paſſed and ſpent by this noble Queene, ſhe perſevering in the expreſſions of like pious actions and ardency of Faith, the next day in the morning betwéen eight and nine of the clocke ſhe departed this life, to take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a far better life, ſwéetly yéelding up her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into the hands of God, the ninth of Iune 1572. the ſixth day after ſhe fell ſick, in the 44. yeare of her age.</p>
               <p>She had her perfect ſpéech alwaies even to the houre of her death: ſhewing not only the ſtayed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſoundneſſe of her judgement (which ever in times paſt ſhe had) in her care about the ſalvation of her ſoule, but in her other worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires alſo.</p>
               <p>Now to avoide all jealouſies and ſuſpitions of her being wronged by poyſon or otherwiſe in this matter of her ſo ſudden ſickeneſſe, her body was opened, by ſundry expert and learned Doctors of Phyſick and Chirurgery, with all exquiſite dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, who found her heart and liver very ſound and untouched, her lungs only excepted, which long before on the right ſide had béen very ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, by reaſon of an extraordinary hardneſſe which they had contracted, and withall a great impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume, which, ſo far as man could judge, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded was the cauſe of her death. But they had no command given them to open the braine, and therefore finding ſomewhat out of frame in her body, they delivered their opinions only concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thus you have with as much brevity as I could, and as the merit of the thing required, the true report of the manner of this vertuous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes ſickneſſe and death, thus ar related unto you; only my requeſt is (ſaith my Author) that if any have a more perfect and particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the excellent parts wherewith the Lord had adorned and beautified her, they would not ſuffer the ſame to be buried in ſilence, but to cauſe it to ſée the light; that on the one ſide it may ſerve as an example to poſterity; and on the other ſide, that we may learne to bleſſe God for her piety and conſtancy.</p>

For he was not ignorant of the deadly hatred they bare him, and therefore wrote unto the Maior of the City, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> to looke unto it at his perill, that the Admirall had no wrong offered him by the Citizens, either at his entrance or continuance in the City. For of all the Cities in that Kingdome it is the moſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and eaſſly moved to ſedition; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Admirall, being of a contrary religion, could expect but ill welcome at his comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: eſpecially becauſe at his ſollicitation the Croſſe of Gaſtines was remoued out of the ſtreet of S. Dennis. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 
                  </p>
                  <p>The Quéene mother and the Duke of Aniou wrote unto the Maior alſo, and likewiſe to the reſt of the Magiſtrates, to the ſame effect; but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to their ſervants, ſome whereof had a little light given them touching that device. To be ſhort, they endeavoured to take all rubbes out of his way, that he might with the leſſe miſtruſt fall into the ſnare.</p>
                  <p>The Admirall, not caſting any perils, reſolved to take his journey to Paris. Albeit he lacked not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſundry advertiſements from his owne followers, and others his well-willers in the Kingdome; who honoured him much, deſiring him, that howſoever <note place="margin">"He gave this teſtimony in his anſwer to theſe adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, that ſince France came to be a Kingdome, it never enjoyed a better King then Charles the ninth.</note> he had no ſiniſter opinion of the "King, of his mother, or any of theirs, yet at leaſt he was to take into his conſideration the place whither he went, and amongſt what enemies he was now to venture himſelfe. But he alwaies leaning upon the teſtimony of a good conſcience, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in Gods providence, not moved by theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> advertiſements, tooke his journey to Paris with very few Attendants. Being come thither, he was honoutably received of the King, of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and of the Quéene mother, with others alſo.</p>
                  <p>The marriage of the king of Navarre with the Kings ſiſter being ſolemniſed on the ſeventéenth and eightéenth of Auguſt, 1572, and all the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs and feaſtings accompanying the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed, the Admirall determining to take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> his leave at the Court, and ſo to returne home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the Deputies of the Reformed Churches brought him their requeſts on a ſudden, to preſent the ſame to the King, in regard of many wrongs the ſaid Churches had ſuſtained; and therefore they inſtantly beſought him, that he would not leave the Court till ſome order might be taken for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>This with other impediments were the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of detaining him ſtill there.</p>
                  <p>Mauravell comming to Paris whileſt theſe <note place="margin">This Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravell was he that ſhot the Admirall.</note> Feaſts laſted, having preſented his ſervice firſt to the King and his mother, the Duke of Aniou, with thoſe of the Guiſe; afterſome ſpéech had with the King and the Quéene mother, one called Chaill had a command to direct him to the houſe whence the blow ſhould be given: who left him with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the ſaid houſe, which woman was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not only to aske his name, but alſo ſo much as to enquire for what cauſe he was lodged there.</p>
                  <p>On Friday, the two and twentieth of Auguſt, in the morning he trimmed up his harquebuſe; watching ſecretly the Admirals comming.</p>
                  <p>The Admirall at his going forth out of the <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure</hi> méeting the King comming out of a Chappell which is before the ſame, paſſing thence to play at Tenniſe, he ſcarcely had gone an hundred paces from the place, but as he returned to his lodging on foot to dine there, attended on by ſome twelve or fiftéene Gentleme, reading a petition; out of <note place="margin">Mauravell hurts the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall.</note> the window of a lodging (where Villemur tutor to the Duke of Guiſe uſually lay) he was ſhot with an harquebuſe charged with thrée braſſe bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, one of which tooke off the fore finger on his right hand, and he was hurt with another in his left arme, Féeling himſelfe thus wounded, hée willed ſome of his followers to enter that houſe, and to enquire who it was that had done that, or who ſet him on worke to doe it: and then to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the King thereof, giving him to underſtand how well his command was obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Now whileſt they were buſie to force open the doore, the murtherer fled out by a back way, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thence out of the gate of Saint Anthony; where one attended him, holding a Spaniſh gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net brought out of the Duke of Guiſes Stable; whereon he galloped away, yet not without ſome difficulty; for flying thus in ſome feare, he fell off his horſe twice ot thrice.</p>
                  <p>A Gentleman ſéeing the Admirall hurt came to ſupport his left arme, binding up the hurt thereon with his handkerchiefe. And thus was he condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to his lodging, which was diſtant from thence about ſome twenty paces. In his paſſage a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſaid it was to be feared the bullets were poiſoned: to which the Admirall replyed, <hi>All muſt be as it pleaſeth God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King hearing of the Admirals hurt left his game, where he was playing till then with the Duke of Guiſe, and throwing away his racket as it ſéemed in an anger, with a ſad and heavy countenance withdrew himſelfe into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; the Duke of Guiſe following him within a while after.</p>
                  <p>The King of Navarre, the Prince of Conde, <note place="margin">The King of Navarre and the Prince Conde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine to the King.</note> with many other of the religion, having notice of the Admiralls hurt, complained to the King of this untimely accident; entreating they might have leave to depart out of the City, ſéeing they could expect little ſafety there. The King made his moane to them of the miſchance that hapned, ſwearing and profeſting that he would execute ſuch impartiall juſtice upon the offendor, and on all the complotters, as ſhould give the Admirall and all his friends content; only he willed them to ſtay, promiſing them ere long to provide for their ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>The Chirurgians and Phyſitians were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent for, amongſt whom was Ambroſe Pare the Kings Chirurgian, a man very expert. He began firſt with the Admirals finger, which put him to much paine, in regard the ſciſſers were not ſharpe enough to cut it off at once; beſides hée was faine to ſtop and open the wound thrice. Then he came to the left arme, making inciſſons in two places into which the bullet had pierced.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65665:37"/> The Admirall endured all this with an undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted countenance, and wonderfull patience, whileſt thoſe which ſtood by and ſaw him ſo nangled could not refraine from teares. Captaine Monins held him with both his armes about the middle, and Cornaton held his hands. He ſéeing them aſtont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, my friends, ſaid he, why wéep you? I thinke my ſelfe happy to be thus handled in the cauſe of <note place="margin">The admirals ſpeech while he was in the Surgeons hands.</note> God. And anone caſting his eyes upon a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter called <hi>Merlin,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>here ye ſee,</hi> my friends, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
                     <hi>Gods bleſſings.</hi> I am hurt indéed; but I know it is come to paſſe by the will of my heavenly Father, humbly thanking his Majeſty in that hée is pleaſed to honor me ſo farre, as to ſuffer any thing for his holy name. Let us pray unto him, that he would grant unto me the gift of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
                  <p>Then looking upon the ſaid Miniſter who wept <note place="margin">This Merlin was miracy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the maſſacre of Paris.</note> over him. Oh Maſter Merlin, ſaith he, what will not you comfort me? Yes ſir, ſaid he; for wherein <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> may you take greater comfort, then in calling to mind how greatly God hath alwaies honored you, in eſtéeining you worthy to ſuffer rebuke for his names ſake, and true religion? The Admirall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; alas, if God ſhould deale with me accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my deſerts, he might have put mée to worſe forments then theſe. But bleſſed be his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name, in that he is pleaſed to take pity on mée his poore and unworthy ſervant. Be of good chéere, ſir, then ſaid another unto him; for ſéeing God hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſpared your more noble part whole, you have cauſe therein to magniſte his goodnes. In theſe wounds you have received from God a teſtimony of his love, rather then of his diſpleaſure, ſéeing hée hath preſerved your head and underſtanding ſafe.</p>
                  <p>Then ſaid Merlin, ſir, you doe well in turning your thoughts away from him who hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this outrage upon you, in looking onely unto God; for no doubt it is his hand that hath ſmitten you: therefore for the preſent, ceaſe to thinke on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the malefector. I aſſure you, ſaid the Admirall, I doe fréely forgive him from the bottome of my heart, and thoſe alſo that are his abettors; being fully perſwaded, that none of them all could have done me the leaſt hurt, no, though with violent hands they had put me to death. For what is death it ſelfe in Gods children but an aſſured paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to an eternall reſt and life?</p>
                  <p>Now as the ſaid Miniſter declared how the evils which happen to the children of God in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> preſent life, doe often incite and quicken them up to poure out their prayers into the boſome of the Almighty, the Admirall preſently with a loud voice and ardent affection prayed thus.</p>

                  <p>Having ended this prayer, Merlin asked him, <note place="margin">The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters pray with him,</note> if it pleaſed him that the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould now pray with him and for him. To whom hée ſaid, yes, with all my heart; I pray you begion. Whileſt Merlin pronounced the prayer, applying the ſame to the preſent occaſion, the Admirall with his eles looking up to heaven expreſſed the ardency of his affection, in conſenting thereunto. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being ended, Merlin began to propound unto the Admirall the examples of the Martyrs, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that from Abel to Abraham, and conſequently hitherto, whoſoever carried themſelves in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée of faithfulneſſe in the houſe of God, felt at one time or other the ſmart of afflictions in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds. The Admirall anſwered, that when hée called to minde the ſufferings of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs and Martyrs, it much comforted him, and helped him ſomewhat to allay the fartneſſe of his afflicted eſtate.</p>
                  <p>The King of Naverre and the Prince of Conde having bitterly bewayled this outrags committed upon the Admirall (as you heard before) about two of the clocke in the afternoone, the King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied <note place="margin">The King &amp; Queene Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came to viſit the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall.</note> with the Quéene MOther, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and other of the Lords, went to viſite the Admirall.</p>
                  <p>The King with teares ſéemed to be excéeding ſorry for that which was come to paſſe, promiſing him, with one blaſphemous oath upon another, to revenge the fact, no leſſe than if it had béen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon his owne perſon: praying him to come and take up his lodging with him, in the lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre, for his greater ſecurity and ſafety, Wherupon, the Admirall, after ſome diſcourſe made to the King in ſecret, gave him moſt humble thankes for ſo great a favour, as to viſite him in his owne perſon.</p>
                  <p>Upon the motion made by the King, Mazilles his chiefe Phyſitian was called, demanding of him, whither the Admirall might ſafely be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thence into the Louvre, or no? His Anſwer to the King was, that it could not be done without danger. Some of the Admirals friends thought if fitting to requeſt a guard of ſouldiers to be aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the King unto him for his better ſecurity. The King anſwered, he liked well of that device, being fully determined to provide for the admirals ſafety as his owne, and would preſerve him no leſſe then the apply of his eie. After this the King cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for the bullet of braſſe wherewith the Admirall was hurt, that he might ſée it, asking whither hée was not put to great paine when his finger was cut off, as likewiſe touching the dreſſing of his arme? Now as Cornaton ſhewed the bullet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his ſléeve all bloudy (becauſe he was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to hold the Admirals arme, while it was in dreſſing) the King asked if that were of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals bloud? and whither ſo much bloud iſſued out of his wounds? adding (after Cornatons anſwer) he never ſaw man in his life ſhew greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and magnanimity of ſpirit then the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall did.</p>
                  <p>Then was the Quéene Mother deſirous to ſée the Bullet, ſaying, I am glad the bullet is taken out; for I remember when the Duke of Guiſe was killed before Orleance, the Phiſitian told me, that if the Bullet were gotten out, there was no danger of death, though it were poyſoned.</p>
                  <p>Then Cornaton anſwered, we have foreſéene that Madame; for being carefull to prevent that

The Lord de la Place ſomwhat amaſed at the audacious malapartneſſe of the man, who, in the midſt of ten or twelve perſons which were there preſent in the roome, durſt preſume to utter ſuch language, askt him if he knew where he was, or whether he thought there was a King or no?</p>
                  <p>To this the Captaine blaſpheming anſwered, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> that he willed him to goe with him to know the kings pleaſure. The ſaid Lord de la Place hearing this, fearing alſo ſome danger to be towards, by ſedition in the City, ſlipped forth at a backe doore behind his lodging, purpoſing to get into a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors houſe. In the meane while moſt of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants vaniſhed out of ſight, and this Captaine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtored himſelfe with a thouſand crowns, was intreated by the Lady Marets, daughter to the ſaid Lord, to convey her father with the Lord Marets her husband into the houſe of ſome Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, which he conſented to doe, and alſo performed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> it.</p>
                  <p>After this, de la Place being refuſed at thrée ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall houſes was conſtrained to retire backe againe into his own, where he found his wife very penſive and grieved beyond meaſure, fearing leſt this Captaine in the end would caſt her ſonne in law and daughter into the river, as alſo for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger wherein her deare husband and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> all his family were.</p>
                  <p>But the ſaid Lord de la Place, being ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by the ſpirit of God with incredible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in the inner man, ſharply rebuked her; and afterwards mildely demonſtrated unto her, that we muſt receive theſe and the like afflictions from the hand of God; and ſo having diſcourſed a while upon the promiſes of God comforted her.</p>
                  <p>Then he commanded ſuch ſervants and maids as remained in the houſe to be called togeher; who being come into his Chamber; according to his cuſtome on the Lords dayes, he made a forme of exhortation to his family: then went to prayer, and began to read a Chapter out of the booke of Iob, with the expoſition or ſermon of Maſter Iohn Calvin upon it. So having ſpoken ſomewhat of Gods mercy and juſtice, which as a good and wiſe father uſeth to exerciſe his elect with ſundry cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, leſt they ſhould bée intangled here below with the things of this World, he ſhewed how néedfull afflictions were for Chriſtians, and that it was beyond the power of Satan or men to hurt or wrong them, unleſſe the Lord of his good pleaſure gave them leave. What néed have we then, ſaid he, to dread their authority, which at the moſt can but prevaile over our bodies? Then he went to prayer againe, preparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his whole family rather to endure all ſorts of torments, yea death it ſelfe, than to ſpeake or doe ought that might tend to the diſhonour of God.</p>
                  <p>Having finiſhed his prayer, word was brought him, that Senecay the Provoſt Marihall with many archers were at the doore of his lodging, commanding the ſame to be opened in the Kings name, ſaying that he came to ſecure the perſon of the Lord de la Place, and to preſerve his houſe from being pillaged by the common ſort. The Lord de la Place having intelligence of this ſpéech commanded the doore to be opened to him, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in declared the great ſlaughter that was made upon the Huguenots every where in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the Kings command; adding this withall in Latine, that he would not ſuffer one to live, <hi>Qui mingat ad Parietem.</hi> Yet have I expreſſe charge from his Majeſty, ſaith he, to ſée that you ſhall ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine no wrong, but only conduct you to the Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre, becauſe the King is deſirous to be informed touching many things about the affairs of thoſe of the Religion, which he hath now in hand, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willed him to make himſelf ready to goe to his Majeſty. The Lord de la Place anſwered, That he alwaies thought himſelfe happy before he left this life, to gaine any opportunity by which hée might render an account to his Majeſty of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and actions.</p>
                  <p>But in regard ſuch horrible Maſſacres were every where committed, it was impoſſible for him to paſſe to the Louvre, without the certaine dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his perſon; praying him to aſſure his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of his willingneſſe to come, the whileſt lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in his lodging as many Archers as hee thought fitting, untill the fury of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Not long after comes into his lodging Preſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Charron, then provoſt of the merchants, with whom conferring a little in ſecret, going his way he left with the foure archers which were there before, foure more of the city archers. The whole night following was ſpent in ſtopping up and fortifying of all paſſages from entring the houſe, with logs and proviſion of Flint-ſtones, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up the windowes, ſo as if ſéemed by this ſo exact and diligent a defence, the archers were left in the houſe, to frée the ſaid de la Place and all his family from the common calamity, till Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necay, returning the next day after two of the clocke in the afternoone, declared that hee had expreſſe charge from the King to bring him to his Majeſty without delay.

                  <p>Seneca on the contrary inſiſted, ſaying, it was <note place="margin">Anno 1572.</note> the common ſpéech of theſe Huguenotes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that they were the Kings moſt loyall and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſubjects and ſervants; but when they were to manifeſt their obedience to his commands, then they came off but ſlowly, ſéeming rather much to abhor and deteſt it. And whereas he pretended dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Seneca anſwered, that he ſhould have a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Paris who was well known to the people, to accompany him As Senecaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued this ſpeech, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the Captaine of Paris ſurnamed Pazon, a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall actor in this ſedition, entred the chamber of the ſaid Lord of Place, offering his ſervice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him through the city to the King; which Dela Place would by no means yeeld unto, telling Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, that he was one of the moſt cruell &amp; bloudy minded men that was in all the City; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſéeing he muſt néeds goe to the King, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated that the ſaid Seneca would be his guard. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> To whom Seneca anſwered, that having now other affaires to looke unto, he could not conduct him above fifty paces.</p>
                  <p>Then his wife (though otherwiſe a very graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and good Lady) out of that entire love which ſhe bare to her husband, proſtrated her ſelf at the féet of the ſaid Seneca, beſeeching and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to accompany her husband to the King. But the ſaid De la place, who never ſhewed any ſigne of a dejected ſpirit, came to his wife, tooke her up from the ground, rebuked her, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> told her, that it is not the arme of fleſh that we muſt ſtoupe unto, but unto God onely.

The midwife ſéeing them bent to murther the woman alſo, now ready to lie downe, inſtantly intreated them to tarry, at leaſt ſo long till the infant (which would be the 20. Childe that God had given her) was borne. Having conteſted ſome while with them, they tooke this poore woman halfe dead with

Therefore on the ſame Sunday the foure and twentieth of Auguſt, about foure of the clocke in the afternoon, a poſt was ſent to Meaux with letters, accompanied with a ſeditious fellow called le Froid. Being come thither, the Packet was preſented to Monſleur Lovis Coſſet, the <note place="margin">This Coſſet was then branded for notorious vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, and a misſhapenfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</note> Kings Atturney there. Upon the receit whereof, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> this Atturny haſted hither and thither in his own perſon to advertiſe ſuch cut-throats (as had had their hands in the pillaging and robbing thoſe of the religion in the firſt, ſecond, and third troubles) with command, that they ſhould be ready to come forth of their houſes armed, at the ſtroke of ſeven of the clock, and then cauſe the gates inſtantly to be ſhut.</p>
               <p>The time prefixed being come, which was about ſupper time, the gates were ſhut, and then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> they began to execute their cruelties in ſundry parts of the City. Thus was that night paſſed, not without uprores and ſtrange events.</p>
               <p>On the next day, which was Munday, about thrée of the clocke in the morning, theſe good Catholikes began to pillage the houſes of the Proteſtants, of the beſt things they had, which continued till eight of the clocke, their trading li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them ſo well. But the principall of all the ſpotles were conveyed into the Court and houſe of this noble Atturney Coſſet; yet theſe were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the beginnings of ſorrows.</p>
               <p>For after robbing and ſpotling they fell to ſhut them up in priſons: which being filled, the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacrers having Coſſet for their Captaine (who uſually carried in each hand a Piſtoll ready to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge) went into the ſaid priſon on Tuesday the ſix and twentieth of Auguſt, about five or ſix of the clock at night, with ſwords, daggers, and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers knives.</p>
               <p>Nigh to this priſon there was a great Court, encloſed on every ſide with walls and a very ſtrong Gate. In a corner whereof is a large paire of winding ſtaires, containing five and twenty, or thirty ſteppes, by which they goe up to the Iudgement Hall to the Seat of Iuſtice. Into this Court were the murderers aſſembled; which done, Coſſet went up into his ſeat. Then they had a ſcroule or bill containing the names of the priſoners there impriſoned, who were called over one by one to the number of two hundred and upwards, as ſome of the murderers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have ſince reported, when as they impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently made their brags of theſe their horrible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties and injuſtices.</p>
               <p>Then the Atturney laughing began to call for the firſt man named in the bill; who being brought forth, and ſéeing naked ſwords before him, falling downe and craving forgiveneſſe of his ſins at the hands of God, was ſuddenly butchered by five or ſixe.</p>
               <p>One Quintin Croyer, an Eiver of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church, being called forth, and ſéeing many of his companions maſſacred before his eyes, knée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe, praying God to pardon theſée murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; at which prayer they fell a laughing, and not being able with their daggers to pierce a Ierkin of double Buſſe which he ware, and which they were loth to ſpoile, (for it was a good booty) they cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the points, and then gave him five or ſix ftabs with a dagger into his body; and ſo this good man wounded to death, calling upon God, rendered up his ſpirit into the hands of him that gave it.</p>
               <p>Faron Haren, a man zealouſly aſſerted to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who had béen Sheriffe of the City in the firſt troubles, having by his endeavours chaſed the Maſſe out of Meaux, for a time was mortally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of theſe ſeditious Papiſts; and therefore they were not contented ſimply to kill him, but firſt cut off his noſe, eares, and ſecret parts, then gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him many ſmall thruſts into divers parts of the body, they conſtrained him to and fro among them, as if he had gone thorow the pikes. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weakened, and not able any longer to hold out, in regard of the blood that iſſued from all the parts of his body, he fell with his face to the ground, and inſtantly calling upon the name of the Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived infinite gaſhes and wounds after he was dead.</p>
               <p>By this time it grew late; therefore theſe blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckers, having almoſt wearied themſelves in worrying theſe poore lambes and ſhéep of Chriſt, deferred the execution of the reſt till after ſupper, as well to take ſome breathing and refection, as alſo to murther the reſidue with the greater alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65665:40"/> ſo loud for mercy, that all the City in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner rung thereof. This maſſacre laſted from nine of the Clock at night till it was midnight.

               <head>¶ <hi>Perſecution of the Faithfull at Troys in Champaigne.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NEwes comming to Troys of the Maſſacre executed at Paris, the greater part of the Iudges and Officers of the King were ſent to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Bailiffe of Troys, with commandement diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make ſcarch for all thoſe of the Religion, from houſe to houſe, and to impriſon as many as they could méet withall.</p>
               <p>In this city there was a Merchant called Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Belin, a man of a turbulent nature. This Belin was at the maſſacre in Paris on S. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomews day; from whence he was ſent with Letters from the King dated the eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of Auguſt, to the Maior and Sheriffes of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Troys, to cauſe all theſe perſecutions to ceaſe, and the priſoners to be ſet at liberty. On the third of September he came to Troys with theſe two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (which had béen firſt publiſhed in Paris) with commandement to deliver them to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Magiſtrates to be proclaimed there alſo.</p>
               <p>But at the firſt entrance into the City, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enquire, that all might heare him, whether they had not executed the Huguenots there as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> they had done in Parts; which was his language thorow the ſtréets till he came home. But even ſome of the Papiſts, who were not ſo cruelly minded, demanded of Belin the contents of the K. letters, whereof they had ſome inkling before. But he, like a Bedlam ſwelling with choler, ſware that whoſoever ſaid they contained any thing ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to varification, lyed. Haſting therefore to the Bailiffes houſe at Troys, after he had deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the packet, and buzzed ſomewhat in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> eare, he put him on to ſée this execution done. Now that the ſame might paſſe the better for currant, the help of the Executioner of Troys was reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, whoſe name was Charles.</p>
               <p>Yet he ſhewing himſelf more juſt and humane than the reſt, peremptorily refuſed to have his hand in an act tending to ſo great cruelty; anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it was contrary to his office to execute any man before ſentence of death had firſt béen pronounced by the Magiſtrate. If they had ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> ſentence to ſhew againſt any of the priſoners, he was ready to doe juſtice; otherwiſe he would not preſume, without a warrant, to bereave any man of his life: and ſo with theſe words he returned home to his houſe.</p>
               <p>Now albeit this anſwer, procéeding from ſuch a kinde of perſon whoſe office and cuſtome it was to ſhed blood, might ſomewhat have aſſwaged and taken off the edge of the moſt barbarous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the world; yet the Bailiffe ſleighting it, was the further enraged. Upon this he ſent for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> one of the Iaylors of the priſon who kept thoſe of the religion; but he being ſicke of a Tertian Ague, Martin de Bures was ſent to know his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The Bailiffe telling him at large what Belin had ſignified to him in private; as alſo, that on a ſudden all the priſoners of the Religion muſt bée put to death, that ſo the place might be purged of them: This (he ſaid) you muſt not faile to doe. But (ſaid the Bailiffe) that the blood may not run into the ſtréets, you ſhall cauſe a trench to be digged in the middeſt of the priſon; and at the two ends thereof ſet certaine veſſels to receive the ſame.</p>
               <p>But this de Bures for ſome conſiderations, as namely thinking the Kings Letters (whereof he had had ſome intelligence) might be proclauned, made no haſt to performe his charge, acquainting no man with ought that had paſſed betwéene the Bafliffe and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m; no not Perennet the Kéeper, who then lay ſick in his bed.</p>
               <p>The next day, being Tuesday, which was the fourth of September, the Bailiffe came into the priſon about ſeven or eight of the Clock, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for Perennet asked of him with a ſmile, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennet, is it done? Perennet, knowing nothing either more or leſſe, asked of him what? Then ſaith the Bailiffe, Why, are not the Priſoners diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched? and thereupon was ready with his dagger to have ſtabbed him. But comming a little better to himſelfe, he told Perennet what his purpoſe was, and now he was to behave himſelfe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the execution thereof; willing him by all meanes not to forget to make the ſaid Trench. At which words this Perennet ſtanding amaſed, though otherwiſe he was a fellow forward enough of himſelfe to commit any outrages againſt the Proteſtants, certified the Bailiffe, that ſuch an inhumane act could not be committed over to him, fearing leſt in time to come Iuſtice might be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed againſt him by the Parents or Allyes of the Priſoners. No no, ſaid the Bailiffe, feare not, I will ſtand betwéene you and all harmes. Others of the Iuſtices have conſented thereto beſides my ſelfe, and would you have better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than that?</p>
               <p>Within a while after, the Iaylor comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the court of the priſon, where the priſoners were abroad recreating themſelves, cauſed every one to reſort to his cabbin or hole, becauſe, ſaid he, the Bailiffe will come by and by, to ſée whether the Kéepers have done as he commanded them: which they did. Then began theſe poore ſhéep to feare they were deſtinated to the ſlaughter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore went preſently to prayer. Perennet inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called his companions about him, reporting to them what the Bailiffe had given him in charge. Then they all tooke an oath to execute the ſame; but approaching nigh to the Priſoners, they were ſo ſurpriſed with feare, and their hearts ſo failed them, that they ſtood gaſing one upon another, having no courage to act ſuch a barbarous cruelty: and ſo returned to the Iaylors lodge, whence they came, without doing any thing.</p>
               <p>But in ſtead of laying this to heart, as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement and warning piece ſent them from above; as if of ſet purpoſe they meant to reſiſt againſt the checks of their owne conſciences, and ſo kick againſt the prickes, they ſent to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne for ſixtéene pints of the beſt wine, Troys meaſure, with ſhéepes tongues, and other viands, and intoxicating their braines with wine, they drew a liſt or Catalogue of all the priſoners; which they delivered to Nicholas Martin, one of their Confederates, who was to call them forth as he ſaw their names ſet downe in the ſcroule; and thus as they came forth they maſſacred them.</p>
               <p>Ludot one of the priſoners, being called forth as his turne came, preſented himſelfe before them with a chéerefull countenance, calling upon the name of the Lord. Now as he was to receive the ſtroke of death from theſe deſperate blood-ſpillers, he prayed them to forbeare him a little, till he had put off his doublet, being oiletted, which he was wont to put on when any tumult grew in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and having himſelfe unlaced it, preſenting his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65665:40"/> naked breaſt unto them, he received the blow, and <note place="margin">Anno 1569.</note> fell downe dead.</p>
               <p>But poore Meurs eſcaped not ſo good cheape; for his turne being come, he was no ſooner in their ſight, but one of them let drive at him with the point of his Halbert, redoubling the ſame oft to have killed him, yet could not. The poore man ſéeing himſelfe thus dealt withall by the Caitiffe, and no end made, tooke hold with his hands on the point of the halbert, and himſelfe pointing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> him to the ſeat of the heart, cryed to the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer with a ſtedfaſt voice, <hi>Here, ſouldier, here, right at the heart, right at the heart,</hi> and ſo finiſhed this life.</p>
               <p>Howſoever in this maſſacre theſe two formerly mentioned are for brevities ſake only named, yet by that which immediatly followes you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they were not a few who ſuffered in this tragedy.</p>
               <p>The Maſſacre (ſaith my Author) being ended, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the murtherers made a great pit on the back ſide of the Chappell of the priſon, whereinto they caſt the bodies one upon another, ſome of them yet breathing. So as one called Maufere lying in the midſt of them, was eſpied to raiſe up himſelfe above his fellow Martyrs in this pit, upon whom they forthwith throwing earth (as was reported) ſtifled him, being but halfe dead. But becauſe the order which the Bailiffe ſet downe was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, namely the making of a trench in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> to receive the blood which was ſhed, it ran in ſuch abundance out at the priſon doore, and thence through a channell into a river nigh thereto, that it was turned into the colour of blood. Which ſome of the Papiſts themſelves taking notice of, being ignorant of the fact, were ſo terrified therewith, that they ran along the ſtréet, crying and pointing at every one they met withall to behold this horrible and lamentable a ſpectacle. Whereupon many haſting to the priſon by this occaſion, could conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> no other but that the priſoners had ſlaine one another.</p>
               <p>This was preſently noiſed through the City, inſomuch as ſome went to informe the lieutenant and bailiffe thereof. But what? it was as if they had run to the Wolves to tell them the Shéepe were devoured.</p>
               <p>Whileſt this ſo ſavage a cruelty was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the priſon, one Bartholmew Carlet a Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, priſoner there for debt (who of all the troupe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of murtherers in Troys was one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall) having in the former troubles exerciſed moſt notorious cruelties againſt thoſe of the Religion, was called in by theſe maſſacrers to be one of their aſſociates; who executed his part in ſo bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a manner, that (as himſelfe afterwards often acknowledged) he with his owne hands ſlaughte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thirty of theſe poore innocents: So far was he growne paſt ſhame or common honeſty. But this his fact was ſo pleaſing to certaine of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> Popiſh Religion at Troys, that for a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thereof they payed his debt, and ſet him frée out of priſon; which was done (as the report went) by making a collection for him in certaine Pariſhes.</p>
               <p>The next day after, which was the fifth of September, this worſhipfull Bailiffe of Troys, that he might apply the plaiſter when the parties were dead, cauſes the Kings Letters, which he had received the thirtieth of the moneth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> before going, to be publiſhed in all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the City with ſound of Trumpet. The Bailiffe (as we have béen credibly informed) was preſent in perſon at the publication, and as the Notary read the contents thereof to him, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the ſame jéeringly, and not with a full and audible voice, as matters of ſuch conſequence ought to be read.</p>

But as ſome of themſelves have ſince reported, there were eightéen thouſand murdered, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> beſides women and children. The manner of their death was, firſt to ſheet them with Piſtols, then to ſtrip them of their clothes, and either drowning or elſe burying the dead bodies in pits, namely ſuch as dwelt about the wals.

               <p>On Tuesday at night certaine of this bloody crue came and knocked at the doore of one that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> was a Doctor of the Civill Law, called Taille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous; who opening a Caſement, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they had ſomewhat to ſay to him, came downe immediatly, and opened the ſame unto them.

Whereupon he fell to prayer, and that with ſuch conſtancy and affection, that the maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crers being aſtoniſhed, and by a ſecret celeſtiall power reſtratned, contented themſelves onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> with taking his purſe, in which there were fiftéen Crownes, and ſo left him, offering him no more violence.</p>
               <p>The day following certaine Schollers reſorting to his lodging, requeſted of him that they might ſée his Library, into which having brought them, one asked this booke of him, and another another, the which he willingly gave them.

               <p>A rich Burgeſſe of the City called Nicholas Bougars Sieur de Nove, a man of ſingular worth, and highly eſtéemed of all, was at that time deadly ſick.

               </head>
               <p>ON Wedneſday the ſeven and twentieth of Auguſt in the yeare 1572. about ſixe of the clocke in the morning, Sieur Mandolet governour of Lyons was advertiſed of the Maſſacre at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris; and within an houre and an halfe after, a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier paſſing through the ſtréets made it knowne to the people, that the Admirall, and all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Princes were ſlain. By and by the gates of <note place="margin">Huguenots he called them.</note> the City were ſhut, and guards of ſouldiers placed here and there.</p>
               <p>But leſt thoſe of the Religion ſhould be moved with ſuch an unwonted and an unexpected ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in of the gates (as in the time of open warre) the Roman Catholiques cauſed it to be bruited that all was done to ſecure the Proteſtants, To which report ſome gave too much credit (for beſide the ordinary guard of the governour, and that of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> the Citadell, with the thrée hundred harquebuſiers of the City, which amounted to about a thouſand) there were gathered to them many beſides of the City with armes likewiſe; with command that if they deſcried any troupe of thoſe of the Religion comming abroad, though but with their ſwords guirt unto them, forthwith to cut them off with the reſt alſo. But they, having enured themſelves to an incredible modeſty and patience, gave not the leaſt appearance of defending themſelves, ſéeing a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> tempeſt now nigh at hand; which they knew could not ariſe without a ſpeciall providence of God.</p>
               <p>The day following, notwithſtanding all theſe faire ſhewes, they evidently perceived that their lives were at the mercy of the Papiſts, who had ſucked the bloud of many of them in the firſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. For albeit they found no more paſſage for them out of the City then they did the day prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, they might not now either fréely goe out or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> come in upon their neceſſary occaſions: if they preſented themſelves in the ſtréets, they were clapt up in priſon; for which cauſe they were fain to kéep their houſes. Night being come, they made a prioy ſearch in their dwelling houſes; ſome they rifled, others were ranſomed, and the reſt impriſoned. Many of them never comming thither, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther killed in the corners of the ſtréetes with dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or elſe caſt into the river; whereof ſome (who were living when this Hiſtory was in writing) were ſaved by ſwimming, being carried down with the current of the ſtreame, halfe a mile beneath the City.</p>
               <p>On Friday after there was a Proclamation with ſound of trumpets in all the chiefe places of the City, the ſumme of which was this, that thoſe of the Religion were to appeare before the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour at his houſe, there to be informed what the Kings pleaſure was concerning them. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, being but too credulous, feared not to make their appearance at the place aſſigned, whence ſoone after they were committed to ſundry priſons. The night following there were heard from all parts of the City lamentable cries and ſhréekings, not onely of ſuch as were maſſacred in their houſes, but of others halfe wounded to death whom they haled to the river.</p>
               <p>From that time forwards there were ſuch mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and outrages committed, throughout the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it ſéemed hell was ſet open, and that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in the likeneſſe of men comming forth thence ran roring to and fro in the ſtréets.</p>
               <p>On Sunday which was the laſt of this moneth of Auguſt, about eight of the clock in the morning, the reſt, who were left unmaſſacred the Fryday before, were made an end of then.</p>

               <p>The firſt alleadged, that if according to the courſe of Iuſtice ſentence of death had béen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them, he knew what he had to doe; but for this their purpoſe he told them he thought they might have but too many executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the City to ſatisfie their deſire. The ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers anſwered, they thought it more then inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, to cut the throats of ſuch as never offended them. But if the priſoners had made any Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or ſedition in the City, they then might have ſome colour of reaſon to doe it; otherwiſe they meant not to ſtaine the honor of their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (which is accompanied with nobleneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) with ſo villanous an act, more beſitting butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers then ſouldiers.</p>
               <p>But Mandelot and his accomplices were not ſo ſcrupulous; for within thrée houres after, <hi>Clou</hi> Captaine of the Harquebuſters of the City came with an enraged troupe, &amp;c. the greater part wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were furniſhed with ſhort ſwords and hangers.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as <hi>Le Clou</hi> entred into the great Court, he gave the priſoners to underſtand with a loud voice, that they muſt die; and turning him towards his ſlaughter men, he ſaid, on, on, goe in, and to your worke: but firſt he forgat not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the priſoners purſes for his booty, which when he pocketted up, he gat him into a Gallery there, to ſatisfie his helliſh luſt in taking a view of this rufull ſpectacle.</p>

Méeting his wife at his entrance into the houſe, he ſaluted her and kiſt her, as it is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in France, eſpecially among the Courtiers, and asked her where her husband was? She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, that he was walking in his garden, and then directed him the way unto him.</p>
               <p>Monſoreau having lovingly embraced La Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viere, ſaid unto him, Doe you know wherefore I am come? the King hath commanded me to kill you forthwith, and hath given me expreſſe charge to doe it, as you ſhall know by his letters. After which words he ſhewed him a piſtoll ready char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Riviere reylyed, that hee knew not wherein he had offended the King; but ſéeing, ſaith he, you ſéeke my life, give me a little leave to cry to God for mercy, and to recommend my ſpirit into his hands.</p>
               <p>Having made a ſhort prayer, he willingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his body to the murtherer, who ſhot him in with his piſtoll, and ſo he died by and by.</p>
               <p>Not long after the King ſent Puygaillard, who drowned nine or ten, and amongſt other the wife of this Miniſter de la Riviere above named, who
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65665:42"/> expreſſed a ſingular conſtancy of faith even to her laſt breath.</p>
               <p>This Miniſter and Martyr formerly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſirnamed Launay, was the eldeſt ſon of Sieur de Launay, a man excéeding rich and wealthy, but an obſtinate Papiſt. When as the old man obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved how his ſon was inclined to be a profeſſor of the Goſpell, he threatened to diſmherit him unleſſe he would abjure, promiſing on the contrary to beſtow great matters upon him, and to marry him honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> if he would be ruled by him. All which his ſon refuſing, his fathers love began to be turned into hatred; inſomuch that the young man was forced to fly to Paris, where in time he was called to bee a Miniſter of the firſt reformed Church planted in that City, under the raigne of King Henry the ſecond; from which reformed Church other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in divers Cities in France fetched their light. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>

               <p>WIthin a mile of Paris there is a place where thoſe of the Religion, which dwelt thereabouts, were wont to aſſemble to heare Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and to participate of the Sacraments.

               <p>In proceſſe of time he came to be eſtabliſhed the Miniſter of this foreſaid Church nigh unto Paris.</p>
               <p>Hearing newes of the Maſſacre, hée fled with the reſt for company. Being apprehended, he began to waver, perſwading many priſoners <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> to revol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> as he had done; which cauſed him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, if his repentance was ſound, to utter theſe words in a booke which I have, wherein hée bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>térly lamented his wofull fall. The murtherers, ſaith he, by their cruell hands murthered mens bodies, whilſt their ſouls eſcaped ſafe; but I by my perſwaſions have béen a killer of ſoules, in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them from the truth which before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</p>
               <p>The Iudge who had him in bonds ſent letters preſently to Paris, to give notice of his apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as alſo of ſome apparent ſignes which gave him hope of the Miniſters converſion.</p>
               <p>The King by and by ſent for him; who being brought into his preſence, ſubſcribed inſtantly to an abjuration with deteſtation of the Huguenots profeſſion, before the King of Navarre and the Prince of Conde, maintained the Romiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, conſented therto with the Sorboniſts at that time there preſent; againſt whom a few yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had learnedly defended the truth.</p>
               <p>In this abjuration he endeavoured to confute many articles which were maintained by Calvin and Beza againſt the Romiſh Religion. In theſe diſputes, this Miniſter being of a prompt wit, and having ability to expreſſe himſelfe well, handled the matter ſo cunningly, that the King of Navarre, the Princeſſe his ſiſter, and the Princeſſe of Conde ſo far yéelded, that within five or ſix dayes after they went to maſſe, and received abſolution of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of Bourbon.</p>
               <p>The points about which this Roſter diſputed were theſe, Firſt, concerning the markes of the Church; Secondly, of the Trinity of Perſons; Thirdly, of the Incarnation of Ieſus Chriſt; Fourthly, of Chriſts deſcent into hell; Fifthly, of originall ſinne; Sixthly, of the providence of God; Seventhly, of predeſtination and reprobation; Eightly, of mans frée will, Ninthly, of Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Tenthly, of ſucceſſion; Eleventhly, of interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints; Twelfthly, of the ſacrifice of the maſſe; and laſtly of Tranſubſtantiation. The Sorboniſts cauſed this confeſſion to be printed, to which the Miniſters of the reformed Religion would not vouchſafe an anſwer, knowing that hée who made it did it contrary to his own conſcience, adding nothing thereto which had not béen confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a thouſand times.</p>
               <p>All this upon his repentance he afterwards revoked, as is to be ſéene by his booke printed here in London in the French tongue, in the yere 1573, which confeſſion of his contrary to his abjuration I have in my cuſtody.</p>
               <p>Now touching the Prince of Conde, the King propounded to him thrée things, either to goe to maſſe, to die, or elſe perpetuall priſon: and therefore to bethink himſelfe well which of the thrée he liked beſt.

               <head>¶ <hi>A maſſacre at Tholouſe in France.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ON Sunday which was the eight day after the maſſacre of Paris, about eight of the clocke in the morning, the chiefe of the Papiſts received advertiſement of that which had paſſed, with let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters directing them what they were to doe. Then a Councell was called, at the breaking up where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the great gates of the City were ſhut, only the wickets left open, at which there was ſet ſuch to watch as they thought fitting. Soone after it was noyſed through all the City, that the Lords and Gentlemen of the Religion were maſſacred at Paris. Which the Proteſtants at Tholouſe nothing, being gone forth about five of the clocke in the morning to heare the Sermon at Caſtanet, ſome thought it fit not to returne, but to reſort to ſome other place: others reſolved to goe backe againe, that they might take order about their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. Theſe, being ill adviſed, were ſuffered to enter in peaceably, leaving their ſwords and dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65665:43"/> at the gate. At evening ſouldiers were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <note place="margin">Anno 1527.</note> here &amp; there; but in regard many Counſellors of the Religion were abroad (that they might the better entrap them) the next day the gates were not ſo carefully looked unto, but who would might come in, and goe out at their leiſure, without being queſtioned at all. This who done to draw in the ſimple people who wandred up and downe the fields. The firſt preſident called Daſis, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle headed man, ſent to the Counſellors abroad <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> to come in, promiſing them their ſafety upon his word, ſhewing that their abſence did but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe the Inhabitants of Tholouſe the more againſt them. It was granted indéed, that there had been a Maſſacre at Paris, but that was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome private quarrell, ſo as the King was not minded for that to breake his edict of pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Some of them were perſwaded and returned; others caſting ſome perill reſolved to retire to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Mountauban, Realmont, and elſewhere. On Tueſday following, that they might hold them whom they had gotten within the Walls, and draw in ſuch as yet kept themſelves without, they cauſed it to be publiſhed with ſound of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets; that the Kings will was that none of the religion ſhould be moleſted, but reſpectively uſed. The preſidents with ſundry others were preſent at this Proclamation, accompanied with a guard of ſouldiers, which cauſed many of the Religion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> eſpecially the Counſellors, to ſuſpect ſome treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; who therefore haſtened to the firſt preſident to know what theſe things meant. He anſwered, it was onely to reſtralue the people from making a tumult. But perceiving that they could not by their cunning catch the birds who kept alooſe off, they wrecked their malice upon thoſe they had in their hands.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday next then, about ten of the clocke in the morning, having ſeparated their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Troupes into divers quarters, they cauſed them to enter into the houſes of thoſe of the Religion, whom they impriſoned in ſundry priſons of the City. This buſineſſe held them all that Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. The guard was doubled at the gates, and one of the Parliament, with a Merchant that was a Papiſt, deputed as commanders at the ſaid gates, to examine all ſuch as went out, and to put backe ſuch as meant to eſcape. There was alſo a charge given, that none ſhould dare to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> any of the ſaid Religion, as they would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the contrary. By meanes whereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being diſcovered, were impriſoned. Among which were five or ſix Counſellors, men excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned, who comforted the reſt. Thus were they detained thrée wéeks. In the meane while the Maſſacrers ſet upon the neighbour Cities.</p>
               <p>The thrée wéeks being expired, they put all theſe priſoners together into the Conſciergery, which is a ſpeciall priſon. After which they began <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> to manifeſt themſelves: for the reaſon why they had deferred the ſlaughter of them ſo long, was, that they might obtaine authority from Paris; the which was brought them by their Deputies, whoſe names were Delpech and Madron, rich Merchants of the City. Theſe came with a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the King, that if the Maſſacre was not finiſhed then they ſhould not deferre any longer to put his will in execution. To which they ſhewed themſelves but too forward and ready.</p>
               <p>On Saturday morning before the Summe was up, certaine ſchollers who were night walkers, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> with other lewd fellowed to the number of ſeven or eight, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

It was thought that they maſſacred to the number of thrée hundred: afterwards ſpoiling them of all they had, ſtripping them out of their cloathes and ſhirts, and leaving them naked, their ſecret parts <note place="margin">Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred in the City of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe in France.</note> being onely covered with a piece of paper. They were expoſed to the view of all for the ſpare of two daies; whileſt they digged great pits, whereinto the corpſes thus cruelly maſſacred were caſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked one upon another.

               <p>Soone after the maſſacre at Paris, tidings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> thereof came to Bourdeaux. Where it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a morning as the Proteſtants were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king boat to heare a Sermon in a meadow where they were wont to meet, being about three miles from Bourdeaux, betweene the river of Garonna and the brooke of la Jalla, that the Governour Mountferrand commanded them to come backe again. He had the shift to cloake the ſame under a plauſble pretence, namely, that they ſhould not be ſet upon there by the multitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> After their returne they began to ſet a ſtrong watch and ward at the gates, ſo as none of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion could have leave to paſſe forth, unleſſe he had a paſſeport from the Governour; yet meanes was made for their Miniſters eſcape without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perceived; who went to Medo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Inſtantly thereupon there arrived at Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux the Lord of Montpeſat from the King, who at his firſt comming fained as if he meant to ſettle all things in peace.

               <p>Many being terrified with theſe threates, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the intreaties of their kindred, who ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65665:44"/> fore them the imminent danger which hung over <note place="margin">Anno 1572.</note> their heads, revolted and abjured. The ſaid Sieur of Montpaſſet cauſed Maſter William Blanck, an Advocate in the Court of Parliament, to be called before him, who was counſellor to him and to his father in law; exhorting and perſwading him to returne to the unity of the Romane church.</p>
               <p>Le Blanck anſwered, that he had ſufficiently weighed and compared all things together, before he tooke upon him the profeſſion of that Religion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> which he now profeſſed; which he ſaid was the true religion, acknowledging the ſame in every reſpect far to excéed the other.</p>
               <p>Montpeſſat hearing this, rebuked him ſharply; ſaying, that then he thought himſelfe wiſer than the King and all thoſe that profeſſed as his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie did. Inſomuch as they who ſtood about Le Blanck began to handle him roughly; ſo that hée had much adoe to eſcape with his life, had not Montpeſſat reſcued him from that danger, becauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> he was come thither upon his word. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour ſaid, if he had béen there he would have ſlaine him.</p>
               <p>The Governour, being preſſed to diſpatch this maſſacre at Bourdeaur, wiſt not well what to do. For on the one ſide La Sieur de Veſins, with ſundry others comming from the Court, aſſured him from the King, that he wondred why the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe was deferred ſo long; ſhewing, that he could not performe a more acceptable ſervice unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> him than it. On the other ſide Stroſſi, who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered about Rochel to take it, wiſhed him to be well adviſed what he did, what command ſoever he had to the contrary: Foreſéeing belike, that if he went forward with this execution, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers would have had the ſaid Stroſſi in ſuch a jealouſie, that his project would have béen defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo would be no ſmall prejudice to the Kings affaires; putting him in hope, that he would ſtand betwéen him and all perils. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 
               </p>
               <p>For the truth is, the army by ſea, which was prepared againſt Rochel, lying for a time at Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux, under pretence of conquering Florida, would have béen ready enough to have made a generall maſſacre there, but that they were afraid the Rochellers would be incenſed thereat.</p>
               <p>Yet in concluſion the Governour, having bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced things on both parts, was perſwaded by the Sieur Montpeſſat to put the maſſacre in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. To which purpoſe an oath being taken, a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> catalogue was made of ſuch as they meant to ſpoile.</p>
               <p>On Saturday then, which was the third of October, 1572. the Governour having aſſembled together all the ſcum of the City to aide and aſſiſt him in ſo barbarous an act, commanded them with other ſouldiers to be ready preſently after dinner to put the Kings command into execution. To which they were very forward, comming in their Liveries, attended on by Captaines of tens, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> direct them touching that they had to do. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the maſſacrers had red hats given them by Peter Eſtounach, and for the blood wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they dyed their armes, they were called the Red Band: others called them the Cardinalls Band. The Governor commanded them to kil all thoſe of the Religion, eſpecially ſuch as had taken armes, and not to ſpare one. And himſelfe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſhew them the way, went to the houſe of Maſter Iohn Guilloch, Lord of Obiere, counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> in the Court of Parliament, to execute the hatred he had long ſince conceived againſt him: who being about to eſcape away out at a backe doore, they caught and brought him into the outer court before his houſe, in the preſence of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who with a ſhort ſword maſſacred him; which done, his houſe was wholly pillaged.</p>
               <p>At that time they brought a certaine Miniſter out of the Conſciergery, who a few daies before comming from the country Saintong to Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux (for his better ſafety as he thought) was there apprehended and impriſoned: and as ſoon as he was come out of the priſon they maſſacred him before the gates of the Palace.</p>
               <p>Maſter William Savins houſe (a Counſellor of the ſaid Parliament, who was one of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) was forced open, pillaged and ſpoiled, and himſelfe cruelly murthered. His Clarke called Simonet, ſéeing his maſter about to be maſſacred, embraced and comforted him: and being asked whether he were of the Religion, he anſwered yea, and would die with his maſter for the ſame. Thus they were ſlaine one in anothers armes.</p>

               <p>A Deacon of the reformed Church called Du Tour, an old man, who in the daies of his ignorance had béene a Prieſt in the popiſh church, being ſick in his bed, was haled forth into the open ſtréet; of whom it being demanded, whether he would go to Maſſe, and thereby ſave his life; he fréely anſwered, No, eſpecially now drawing ſo néere his end, both in regard of his yeares and gréevous ſickneſſe: I hope (ſaith he) I ſhall not ſo far forget the eternall ſalvation of my ſoule, as for feare of death to prolong this life for a few dayes; for ſo I ſhould buy a ſhort terme of life at too déere a rate.

               <p>Then they came to horſes, cats, rats, moules mice, and dogges. After theſe were ſpent, they fell to eat oxe and cow-hides, ſheep-skins, parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, old ſhooes, bullockes, and horſehoofes, hornes of lanthornes, ropes, and horſe harneſſe, leather gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the end of Iune the third part of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged had not bread to eat.

There they eat meale of chaffe, nut-ſhels, and of ſlate, excrements of horſes, and men, yea, the offall which lay in the ſtréets was not ſpared.</p>
               <p>The nine and twentieth of Iuly, a poore man and his wife were executed for having eaten the head, braines, and entrailes of a young childe about thrée yeares old which died of hunger; having made ready the other parts to eat at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meale.

Have I not read it in my Bible? In uttering theſe with the like ſpéeches he yéelded up the ghoſt the thirtieth day of Iuly.</p>
               <p>That all the people died not of famine in the end of this moneth, it was by reaſon of certain hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which were reſerved for ſervice if néed ſhould be, and ſix kine which were left to give milk for the ſuſtenance of young infants.

               <p>There died by fight in Sancerre but eighty four perſons, but of the famine more than five hundred. Many ſouldiers getting forth as they could out of the City, flying from the famine, choſe rather to dye by the ſword of the enemy; whereof ſome were ſlaine, others impriſoned, and the reſt put to death by the executioner.</p>
               <p>But when all helpe of man failed, the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſworne that he would make them eat up <note place="margin">God ſent theſe good men in due ſeaſon from a farre countrey to preſerve this diſtreſſed city thom utter ruine.</note> one another, the King of Kings delivered them by his wonderfull providence.

               <p>By vertue of this Edict, upon the tenth day of Iuly, about ten of the clocke in the forenoone, the Sieur of Biron entred into the City at the gate called de Coigne, with an Herauld of armes, and foure of the Kings Trumpetters (at which houre peace was proclaimed in the moſt eminent places thereof) accompanied with the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the City, and with the Lord of Villiers. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> After which, dining at the Maiors houſe, he ſoone after retyred, being conducted along till he came without the City.</p>

               <p>IN the yeare 1574. Charles the ninth, King of France (in the time of whoſe raigne theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named execrable maſſacres were executed) fell ſicke; which ſickneſſe ſeiſed upon him before his brother the Duke of Aniou tooke his voyage into Poland: from which during the winter ſeaſon he obtained ſome recovery. But that which then ſéemed to lie hidden brake forth again afreſh in the Spring; ſo as this Prince, after he had langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thrée whole moneths, <hi>viz.</hi> February, March, and April, drew his Phyſitians to a conſultation about the ſtate of his body; who in the end conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to purge and let him blood. But theſe remedies tooke not ſuch an effect as the King and they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; for he ſtill waſted and conſumed away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the flower of his age, to the wonder of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

He began his raigne the firſt of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, 1560. and ſo reigned, as that it gives to poſterity iuſt cauſe both of admiration and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation.

               <head>A note touching a Bull of Pope Sixtus the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> fifth, wherein the King of Navarre, and the Prince of Conde were declared Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques &amp;c. with the cenſure thereof by the Parliament of Paris.</head>
               <p>IN September 1585. Pope Sixtus the fifth, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> a Bull ſent from Rome, condemned the king of Navarre, and the Prince of Conde for Heretikes, excommunicated them, degrading them and their ſucceſſors from their dignities, eſpecially laying claime to the Crowne of France, abſolving their ſubjects from their oath of alleigiance, and expoſing their Countries for a prey to them that could firſt ſubdue them.</p>
               <p>The Court of Parliament of Paris made a notable remonſtrance to the King concerning theſe Buls, in the which they ſought to maintain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the priviledges of the Gallicane Church, Among other things, theſe words that follow are very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. The Court thinks that theſe Buls are ſet forth in a ſtile altogether of a new ſtamp, and ſo contrary to the modeſty of former Popes, that they can in no ſort diſcerne therein the ſpirit of a ſucceſſor of the Apoſtles. And therefore (as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the ſaid Court added) wee can neither find by our regiſters, nor by any antiquity, that the Princes of France ever ſubjected themſelves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſo farre to the authority of the Pope, nor that the Subjects have taken ſuch knowledge of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of their Princes. The Court therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe determine ought thereupon, unleſſe firſt of all the Pope can cauſe his pretended right in tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Kingdoms, to appeare, which Kingdomes were eſtabliſhed and ordained of God, before the name of a Pope was heard of in the world: that he manifeſts not to us what title he hath to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with the matter of the ſucceſſion of a young <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> and vigorous Prince, who, for ought the Pope knows, may have his ſucceſſion yet in his loynes: that he ſhews not with what appearance of juſtice or equity he ſhould deny that priviledge which is allowed to ſuch as ate accuſed of hereſie againſt the decrées of antient canons, namely that no man ought to be held as an heretique, untill his defence be fully and fréely heard, till he have received often admonitions from many Synodes, and there upon ſentenced by a Councell lawfully aſſembled.</p>
               <p>Further they added, that ſéeing the pope in ſtead <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> of inſtruction, breaths forth nothing in his Buls but deſtruction, changing his ſhepherds crooke into a terrible thunderbolt, rather to ſcatter then ſwéetly to call the erring flocke into the Boſome of the Catholique Church, the Court cannot ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admit of, or entertaine a Bull ſo permitious and oppoſite to the generall good of all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World; and to the ſoveraignty of the Crowne of France; yea, they further were of opinion, that this Bull deſerved to be throwne into the fire and burned, and the ſollicitors or upholders thereof <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> for examples ſake to be ſeverely chaſtifed; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſéeching the King to maintaine his Edicts in his owne Kingdome in peace.</p>
               <p>This remonſtrance tooke ſmall effect; for not long after, the King being ſollicited by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall of the league, ſet forth a declaration the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of October, upon the Edict publiſhed in Iuly next before going; wherein having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated the body and goods of theſe of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with their aſſociates, who in any Province had taken armes againſt the fury of the league, it was ordained, that thoſe of the Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſixe moneths were to depart out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, unleſſe within fiftéene daies fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed after the ſaid declaration they ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure.</p>
               <p>The Parliament, ſuffering themſelves to be carried downe by the violence of this ſtreame, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and admitted of this Edict. The Princes framed an oppoſition againſt the Popes Bull, appealing therefrom, as a wrong done unto them, offering to make it appeare in a frée and lawfull Councell, that the Pope had malitiouſly belied them, in calling them Heretiques; ſo as if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed this faire and lawfull courſe by them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, they would hold and eſtéem him for that great antichriſt, and would proclaime an openirre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Not long after, among thoſe of the Religion which were impriſoned, others were more ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled. Among many, take notice here of two honourable Women, whoſe memory ought to be celebrated in this Hiſtory of the Martyrs; namely, Radagonde daughter of Maſter Iohn Foucoult, Atturney in the Parliament of Paris, Widow, of the age of fourty yeares, and Claude Foucoult her ſiſter, a Virgin about thiryt ſix, who were apprehended the nine and twentieth of October 1585. the one of the Village of Pierre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit néere Paris, and the other in the ſuburbs of Saint German, and brought priſoners into Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>elet becauſe they denied to goe to maſſe, and would not abjure and forſake the true Religion. Being ſevered one from the other in priſon, they were examined upon ſundry Articles <note n="*" place="margin">To wit, touching the ſupper of the lord, prayer to ſaints, prayer for the dead, &amp; about abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from meats.</note> to which they made their direct anſwer according to the word of God.</p>
               <p>Then being put together, they were accuſed for diſobeying the Kings commandement, which was that theſe of the Religion were either tode part the Kingdome by ſuch a time, or elſe abjure, They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that they were willing toleave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if they might obtaine a convenient time to take order about that little which they had there; but refuſing to yéeld to their requeſt, they were ſhut up again and theſeventh of November in the preſence of the Lieutenant, as alſo of the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for the King, and a ſorboniſt, they pleaded their Innocency. Theſe men getting no advantage againſt them, but being rather confounded by the Wiſedome of Gods Spirit, ſpeaking by theſe two ſiſters, went and complained to the King, that they were obſtinate Heretiques. This was in the beginning of the yeare 1588.</p>
               <p>They continued in priſon many wéeks, being cumbred with many diſputes, yet remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken. The Friday before Eaſter the "King <note place="margin">Hen. the third.</note> himſelfe was to ſée them, asking them whether they would conforme themſelves to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Apoſtolique Roman church (as he called it) They with ſuch reverence and obeiſance, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them, gave him their reaſons why they could not ſo doe, confirming the ſame by texts of Holy Scripture. His ſecond queſtion was, why they had not obeyed his laſt Edict. The Widow anſwered, ſir, ſaith ſhe, I have thrée ſmall Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to care for; and whereas your Majeſty allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe of the Religion the tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65665:46"/> hee that kept my vineyards of Pierrepit, to quit <note place="margin">{Anno 1588.}</note> himſelfe of me, accuſed me of hereſie, cauſing my ſiſter and my ſelfe to be here impriſoned, where we have lien ſix moneths, and if ſo be our petition preſented by us find no acceptance in your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſight, we moſt humbly beſéech you to grant that we may be fréed out of priſon, and wee will be gone inſtantly out of the Kingdome according to your Majeſties Edict.</p>
               <p>The date is paſt, ſaid the King, nor will I ſhew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> you any favour, unleſſe you will promiſe to goe to maſſe. He was much diſpleaſed in ſéeing their conſtancy. Now at the ſame time there was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before him one ſirnamed Richelot, who had béen apprehended that very day in which the women were taken for the cauſe of Religion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom the King uſed not many words: only, in concluſion hee ſaid, there wanted nothing but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots to burne him. This Richelot abjured that day in which theſe two ſiſters were executed. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> King had five or ſixe Sorboniſts, which attended on him there, who offered to reaſon with the priſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners by occaſion of a word ſpoken by the widow. But the King preventing it, ſaid, we are not come hither to diſpute, let them be laid waſt, and none ſuffered to come to them.</p>
               <p>Within halfe an houre after, the Duke of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville came to viſit them, ſaying, he was ſorry for their affliction, counſelling them to go to maſſe, alleadging, it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt obey thy</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> 
                  <hi>Prince,</hi> and if he therein force you to it againſt your conſcience, he ſhall anſwer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for it; adding, that they were to remember their ſexe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be teachable upon the point of obedience. They anſwered, that no earthly potentate had any warrant to command Chriſtians to ſinne againſt their conſciences.</p>
               <p>They further beſought him to be a meanes for them to the king, that they might be delivered: but all the anſwer he gave them was this, That if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> they would not turne, the King would not deliver them: alſo there was great likelihood, after their long detenſion in priſon, that they muſt be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the end.</p>
               <p>The next day being Eaſter Even, the Quéen with the Ducheſſe of Ioyeuſe came into Chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to viſit the priſoners. But in ſtead of ſpeaking to the two ſiſters her ſelfe, ſhe ſent unto them a wicked Apoſtata, called Mathew de Launy, who being a Miniſter turned popiſh prieſt, and one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> whom the league made no ſmall uſe of; who loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe honourable ſiſters with injuries and reproachfull ſpéeches, calling them dogges and Devils incarnate, and worthy to be burned, ſo left them and never came any more unto them. Soone after the day of the Barricadoes, which is a defence made of earth and ſtones heaped up, ſerving to ſtop a ſtréet or any paſſage, the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Chaſtellot adjudged them to be hangd, and their bodies to be burned to aſhes. From which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> ſentence they appealed to the Court, and were brought into the Conſciergery, which is the name of a common Gaole belonging to Paris or any other priſon.</p>
               <p>On the Even before Saint Iohn Baptiſts day in the moneth of Iune, the common people in Paris making fires as they were wont to doe, amongſt other inſolencies, burnt in divers parts <note place="margin">Queene Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture burned in Paris.</note> of the City a picture repreſenting the Quéene of England.</p>
               <p>The next day the curates and preachers began <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> in their ſermons to thunder, ſaying, That it was not enough to burne the pictures of heretiques, but to burne the bodies of the obſtinate priſoners: which ſo inraged the tumultuous ſort of people, that the day following, flocking together into the court of the palace, they threatned the Preſidents and the Counſell, that ſome miſchiefe ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low unleſſe they condemned theſe two priſoners to dye. A gentle anſwer was returned to this factious crue, with promiſe alſo that the buſines ſhould not long be delayed.</p>
               <p>The next day the eldeſt ſon of Radegonde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a petition to the Ducheſſe of Nemours, daughter to the late lady of Ferrare. Her grace ſollicited the Duke of Guiſe her ſon, for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners: whoſe anſwer was, That his comming to Paris was not to petition the King in favour of thoſe of the Religion; and if he would doe ſo (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſervices which the priſoners had done his grandfather) yet he could not, fearing leſt the mad multitude might ſet upon him.</p>
               <p>The eight and twentieth day of the ſame month of Iune, the Court having confirmed the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence given at Chaſtellot, ſent them backe thither to be executed, ſo as about noone they were gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, becauſe the maid profeſſed, that if they brought her into any Idols Temple, ſhee would extend her voice ſo loud againſt the ſame, that every one ſhould heare it. About thrée of the clocke they were led as ſhéepe to the ſlaughter, where they conſtantly perſiſted in the profeſſion of the true Religion.</p>
               <p>The widow being aſcended the Ladder ſhooke out of her hands a woodden croſſe, which they had by force affixed thereto, whereat the multitude were ſo provoked, that they began to throw ſtones and ſtaves at her, ſo as the hangman having tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her off the Ladder cut the rope by and by, letting her fall halfe dead into the fire, wherein ſhe yéelded up her ſoule into the hands of God, as alſo her ſiſter did.</p>
               <p>¶ Being now come to the yeare, 1588. it gives us juſt occaſion to call to mind that miraculous deliverance of our noble Quéene and Countrey, from the intended invaſion of the Spaniards the ſame yeare. The memoriall whereof, that it might the rather be continued to the ages ſuccéeding, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves by way of hiſtory here to bee inſerted as in its due and proper place. Of which deliverance it may truly be ſaid (all things conſidered) that it was the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes. The true relation whereof here followeth.</p>

               <p>HEr Majeſty of England having had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from ſundry places of the great and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent preparation of the King of Spaine in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts both by ſea and land, not onely of the ſtrongeſt ſhips in all places within his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but of all ſorts of proviſion neceſſary for ſo mighty a Fléet, as hee intended to ſet forth; and theſe rumors of warre, which before were but <note place="margin">The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh navy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> ſleight, daily increaſing, at laſt it was certainely confirmed by the newes on all ſides, that in Spaine there was an invincible Navy prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt England; that the moſt famous cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in military knowledge, and the beſt ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were ſent for into Spaine, from Italy, Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea from America. For the Pope and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Spaniards, and Engliſh fugitives, now recalled the Spaniard to the cogitation of ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65665:46"/> of England, which purpoſe was interrupted by the Portugall warres. They exhorted him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to doe God this ſervice, that had done ſo much for him; now that he enjoyed Portugall with the Weſt-Indies, and many rich Iſlands, to adde England to all, were an eſpeciall ſervice of God, fit for his Catholike Majeſty. By this meanes hee might adde theſe flouriſhing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to his Empire, and ſo kéepe the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countries in peace, and ſecure the navigations to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> both Indies. That the preparations of Spaine were ſo great that no power was able to reſiſt it. They made him beléeve that it was an eaſier matter to overcome England, than to overcome the Dutchland, becauſe the navigation from Spain to England was much ſhorter, than to the Netherlands. And by ſurpriſing of England the other would eaſily follow.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the conſultation began to be had, of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> 
                  <note place="margin">Conſultation about the beſt way &amp; means how to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> the beſt way and meanes to oppreſſe England. Alvarus Baſſanus, the Marqueſſe of S. Croſſe, who was chiefe commander in the Navy, adviſed firſt to make ſure ſome part of Holland or Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, by the Land forces of the Duke of Parma, and by ſending before ſome Spaniſh ſhips, ſo to take ſome place on a ſudden, where the Spaniſh Navy might have a receptacle, and from whence the invaſion might with convenience begin. For in the Engliſh ſea, which is troubleſome, the windes oft changing, and the tides unknowne, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Navy could not be in ſafety. With him agréed Parma who much urged this expedition. Yet others diſliked this counſell, as a matter of great difficulty and danger, of long time, of much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, of great expence, and uncertaine ſucceſſe. And that neither ſecretly nor openly it could be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and eaſily hindered by the Engliſh. Theſe thought that with the ſame labour and expences England might be won: and the victory would be ſure, if a well prepared army from Spaine might with a ſtrong Navy be landed on Thames <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and of a ſudden ſurpriſe London the chiefe City, by an unexpected aſſault. This ſéemed a thing moſt eaſie to be effected.</p>
               <p>The Duke of Parma alſo in Flanders, by the <note place="margin">The Duke of Parma plays his part.</note> commandement of the Spaniard, built ſhips, and a great company of ſmall broad veſſels, each one able to tranſport thirty horſe, with bridges fitted for them ſeverally, And hired mariners from the Eaſt part of Germany. And provided long pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of wood, ſharpened at the end, and covered with yron, with hooks on the one ſide; And twenty thouſand veſſels, with an huge number of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, and placed an army ready in Flanders, of an 103. companies of foot, and foure thouſand horſemen. Among theſe were ſeven hundred En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh fugitives, which were had of all other in moſt contempt. Neither was Stanley reſpected or heard, who was ſet over the Engliſh, nor Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merland, nor any other who offered their help: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> but for their impiety towards their owne countrey were ſhut out from all conſultations, and as men unominous rejected, not without deteſtation. And Pope Sixtus the fifth, that in ſuch a purpoſe would not be wanting ſent Cardinall Alan into <note place="margin">The Pope excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the Queen, &amp;c.</note> Flanders, and renued the Buls declaratory of Pius 5. and Gregory the thirtéenth. He excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth the Quéen, depoſeth her, abſolveth her ſubjects from all allegiance, and as if it had béen againſt the Turks and Infidels, he ſet forth in print a Conceat, wherein he beſtowed plenary indulgences, out of the treaſure of the Church (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> a million of gold, or ten hundred thouſand Duckats, to be diſtributed, (the one half in hand, the other halfe when either England or ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous haven therein ſhould be won) upon all them that would joyne their helpe againſt England. By which meanes the Marqueſſe of Burgain, of the houſe of Auſtria, the Duke of Paſtrana, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mady Duke of Savoy, Veſpaſian Gonzaga, Id. Medices, and divers other noblemen were drawn into theſe wars.</p>
               <p>Quéene Elizabeth, that ſhe might not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at unawares, prepared as great a Navy as ſhe could, and with ſingular care and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence maketh ready all things neceſſary for war.

                  </gap>ſigned the beſt and moſt ſerviceable to each ſeverall imployment. Over the whole Navy ſhe appointed the Lord Admirall Charles Howard, in whom ſhee repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed much truſt; and ſent him to the Weſt parts of England, where Captaine Drake, whom ſhe made Viceadmirall, joyned with him. She com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Henry Seimor, the ſecond ſonne to the Duke of Somerſet, to watch upon the Belgicke ſhore with forty Engliſh and Dutch ſhippes, that the Duke of Parma might not come out with his forces. Albeit ſome were of opinion, that the enemy was to be expected, and ſet upon by land forces, according as it was upon deliveration reſolved, in the time of Henry the eighth, when the French brought a great Navy upon the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſhore.</p>
               <p>For the land fight, there were placed on the <note place="margin">Order taken about the land fight.</note> South ſhores twenty thouſand: And two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies beſides were muſtered of the choiceſt men for war. The one of theſe which conſiſted of 1000, horſe, twenty two thouſand foot, was the Earle of Leiceſter ſet over, and camped at Tilbury on the ſide of Thames. For the enemy was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved firſt to ſet upon London. The other army was governed by the Lord Hunſdon, conſiſting of thirty foure thouſand foot, and two thouſand horſe, to guard the Quéene.</p>
               <p>The Lord Grey, Sir Francis Knolles, Sir Iohn Norice, Sir Richard Bingham, Sir Roger Williams, men famouſly knowne for military experience, were choſen to conferre of the land fight. Theſe thought fit that all thoſe places ſhould be fortified, with men and munition, which were commodious to land in, either out of Spaine, or out of Flanders, as Milford haven. Falmouth, Plimmouth, Portland, the Iſle of Wight, Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, the open ſide of Kent called the Downes, the mouth of Thames, Harwich, Yarmouth, Hul, &amp;c. That trained ſouldiers through all the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time provinces ſhould méet upon warning given, to defend theſe places: that they ſhould, by their beſt meanes and power, hinder the enemy to take land; if he ſhould take land, then ſhould they waſt the Countrey all about, and ſpoyle every thing that might be of any uſe to the enemy, that ſo hee might find no more victuals then what he brought upon his ſhoulders with him. And that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall alarums the enemy ſhould find no reſt day or night. But they ſhould not try any bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, untill divers Captaines were met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their companies. That one Captaine might be named in every ſhire which might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>Two yeares before, the Duke of Parma conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how hard a matter it was to end the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke <note place="margin">A Counſell about peace pretended on the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries part, whileſt they intended to make war.</note> warre, ſo long as it was continually nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and ſupported with ayde from the Quéene, he moved for a treaty of peace, by the meanes of Sir Iames Croft one of the privy Counſell, a man deſhous of peace, and Andrew Loe a Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and profeſſed that the Spaniard had dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated authority to him for this purpoſe. But the Quéene fearing that there was ſome cunning in this ſéeking of peace, that the friendſhip betwéene her and the confederate Princes might bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65665:47"/> and that ſo they might ſecretly be drawne to the Spantard; ſhe deferred that treaty for ſome time. But now, that the wans on both ſides prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red might be turned away, ſhee was content to treat of peace; <note place="margin">It is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of a King, ſaith Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to ſearch out a thing. Delegats ſent into Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders about a treaty of peace</note> but ſo, as ſtill holding the weapons in her hand.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe in February Delegats were ſent into Flanders, the Earle of Darby, the Lord Cobham, Sir Iames Croft, Doctor Dale, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Rogers. Theſe were received with all huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity on the Dukes behalfe, and they preſently ſent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Doctor Dale to him, that a place might be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their treating, and that they might ſee the authority delegated to him by the Spaniſh King. Hee appointed the place néere to Oſtend, not in Oſtend, which then was holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Engliſh againſt the King. His authority delegated he promiſed then to ſhew, when they were once met together. Hee wiſhed them to make good ſpéed in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, leſt ſomewhat might fall out in the meane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> time which might trouble the motions of peace. Richardotus ſpake ſomewhat more plainly, That he knew not what in this interim ſhould be done againſt England.</p>
               <p>Not long after, Doctor Rogers was ſent to the Prince, by an expreſſe commandement from the Quéene, to know the truth, whether the Spaniard had reſolved to invade England, which he and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardotus ſéemed to ſignifie. He affirmed, that he did not ſo much as thinke of the invaſion of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, when he wiſhed that the buſines might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> with ſpéed: and was in a manner offended with Richardotus, who denied that ſuch words fell from him.</p>
               <p>The twelfth of April the Count Aremberg, Champigny, Richardotus, D. Maeſius, and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier, delegated from the Prince of Parma, met with the Engliſh, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>éelded to them the honour both in walking and ſitting. And when they affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that the Duke had full authority to treat of peace, the Engliſh moved, thot firſt a truce might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> be made. Which they dented; alledging that that thing muſt néeds be hurtfull to the Spaniard, who had for ſix moneths maintained a great army, which might not be diſmiſſed upon a truce, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an abſolute peace. The Engliſh urged, That a Truce was promiſed before they came into Flanders. The Spauiard againſt that held, That ſixe moneths ſince a Truce was promiſed; which they granted, but was not admitted. Neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> was it in the Quéenes power to undertake a Truce for Holland and Zealand, who dayly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted hoſtility. The Engliſh moved inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Truce might be generall for all the Quéenes Territories, and for the Kingdome of Scotland: but they would have it but for foure Dutch towns which were in the Quéens hands; that is, Oſtend, Fluſhing, Bergen up Zom, and the Briel; and theſe onely during the Treating, and twenty daies after; and that in the mean time it might bee lawfull for the Quéene to invade <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> Spaine, or for the Spaniard to invade England, either from Spain or Flanders. At laſt, when the Engliſh could not obtaine an abſtinence from armes, and could by no means ſée the Charter by which the Duke of Parma was authoriſed to treat of peace; they propoſed theſe things, That the antient leagues betwéene the Kings of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and the Dukes of Burgondy might bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and confirmed; That all the Dutch might fully enjoy their own priviledges; That with frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> of conſcience they might ſerve God; That the Spaniſh and forraine fouldiers might bee put out of Dutchland, that neither the Dutch nor their neighbouring nations might feare them. If theſe things might be granted, the Quéene would come to equall conditions conceming the townes which now ſhe held (that all might know, that ſhe tooke tooke up armes not for her owne gaine, but for the neceſſary defence both of her ſelfe and of the Dutch) ſo that the money which is owing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be repayed. To the which they anſwered, that for renewing the old leagues there ſhould be no difficulty, when they might have a friendly conference of that thing. That concerning the priviledges of the Dutch, there was no cauſe why forraine Princes ſhould take care, which priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were moſt favourably granted not onely to provinces and townes reconciled, but even to ſuch as by force of armes are brought into ſubjection. That forraine ſouldiers were held upon urgent neceſſity, when as Holland, England, and France were all in armes.</p>
               <p>Touching thoſe Townes taken from the king of Spaine, and the repaying of the money, they anſwered, That the Spaniard might demand for many myriads of Crownes to be from the Quéene repayed him, as the Belgicke war hath coſt him ſince the time that ſhe hath favoured and protected the Dutch againſt him.</p>
               <p>At this time Doctor Dale by the Quéens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, going to the Duke of Parma, did gently expoſtulate with him touching a booke printed there, ſet out lately by Cardinall Allen, where in he exhorts the Nobles and people of England and Ireland to joyn themſelves to the King of Spains forces, under the conduct of the Prince of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, for the execution of the ſentence of Pope Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus the fifth againſt the Quéene, declared by his Bull; in the which ſhe is declared an heretike, ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, cruell againſt Mary Quéene of Scots, and her ſubjects were commanded to help Parma againſt her: (for at that time a great number of thoſe Bulls and Books were printed at Ant werp to be diſperſed through England.) The Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that he had ſéen ſuch a Bull or Booke, neither would he doe any thing by the Popes authority, as for his owne King, him he muſt obey. Yet hee ſaid, he ſo obſerved the Quéen for her princely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that after the King of Spaine he offered all ſervice to her. That he had perſwaded the King of Spaine to yéeld to this treaty of peace, which is more profitable for Engliſh than Spaniſh: for if they ſhould be overcome they would eaſily repaire their loſſe, but if you be overcome the Kingdome is loſt.</p>
               <p>To whom Dale replyed, That our Quéea was ſufficiently furniſhed with forces to defend the Kingdome. That a Kingdome will not eaſily be gotten by the fortune of one battell, ſéeing the King of Spaine in ſo long a warre is not yet able to recover his antient patrimony in the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</p>
               <p>Well, quoth the Duke, be it ſo, theſe things are in Gods hands.</p>
               <p>After this the Delegates contended among themſelves by mutuall replications, weaving and unweaving the ſame web. The Engliſh were earneſt in this, that fréedome of religion might be granted at leaſt for two yeares to the confederate Prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ces. They anſwered, That as the King of Spain had not intreated that for Engliſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes; ſo they hoped the Quéen in her wiſedome would not intreat any thing of the King of Spaine which might ſtand againſt his honor, his oath, and his conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tence.</p>
               <p>When they demanded the money due from the States of Brabant, it was anſwered, That the money was lent without the Kings authority or privity: but let the account be taken, how much the money was, and how much the King hath ſpent in theſe wars, ond then it may appeare who ſhould looke for repayment.</p>
               <p>Thus the Engliſh of ſet purpoſe were from time to time driven off, untill the Spaniſh fléet was come néere the Engliſh ſhore, and the noiſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65665:47"/> of Guns were heard from Sea. Then had they leave to depart, and were by the Delegates hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably brought to the borders néere to Calts. The Duke of Parma had in the meane time brought all his forces to the Sea ſhore.</p>
               <p>Thus this conference came to nothing; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the Quéene, as the wiſer then thought, to avert the Spaniſh fléet; continued by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, that he might oppreſſe the Quéene, being as he ſuppoſed unprovided, and not expecting the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> danger. So both of them tryed to uſe time to their beſt advantages.</p>
               <p>In fine the Spaniſh Fléet well furniſhed with <note place="margin">Preparation for ſetting forth of the Spaniſh fleet</note> men, munition, Engines, and all warlike prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the beſt indéed that was ever ſéen upon the Ocean, called by that arrogant title the Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Navy, conſiſting of a hundred and thirty ſhips, wherein there were ninetéene thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ninety; Mariners eight thouſand thrée hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty: chained rowers eleven thouſand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and eighty: great Ordnance eleven thouſand ſix hundred and thirty. The chiefe commander was Perezius Guſmannus, Duke of Medina Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia; (For Antonius Colunma Duke of Palian and Marqueſſe of Saint Croſſe, unto whom the chiefe government was allotted, dyed whileſt things were preparing.) And under him alſo Ioannes Martinus Ricaldus, a man of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in Sea affaires.</p>
               <p>The 30. of May they looſed out of the River <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> 
                  <note place="margin">The time when the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy ſet out.</note> Tagus, and purpoſing to hold their courſe to the Groine, in Gallitia, they were beaten and ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a tempeſt: thrée Gallies by the helpe of David Gwin an Engliſh ſervant, and by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſſe of the Turkes which rowed, were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away into France. The Fléet with much adoe after ſome dayes came to the Groine and other harbours néere adjoyning. The report was, <note place="margin">The great fleet ſore ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a tempeſt.</note> that the Fléet was ſo ſhaken with this tempeſt, that the Quéen was perſwaded, that ſhe was not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to expect that Fléet this yeare. And ſix Francis Walſingham, Secretary, wrote to the Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, that he might ſend backe foure of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſhi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, as if the war had béen ended. But the Lord Admirall did not eaſily give credit to that report; yet with a gentle anſwer entreated him to beléeve nothing haſtily in ſo important a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: As alſo that he might be permitted to kéepe thoſe Shippes with him which hée had, though it were upon his owne charges. And finding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> a favourable winde turned Sailes towards Spaine, to ſurpriſe the enemies ſhaken Ships in their harbours. When he was not far from the ſhore of Spaine, the winde turned, and hée being charged to defend the Engliſh ſhore, fearing that the enemies unſéene might by the ſame wind be driven to England, he returned unto Plim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</p>
               <p>Now with the ſame winde, the twelfth of Iuly, the duke of Medina with his fléet departed from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> the Groine. And after a few daies he ſent Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus Telius into Flanders, to advertiſe the duke of Parma, giving him warning that the fléet was approaching, and therefore he was to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ready. For Medina his Commiſſion was to joyne himſelfe with the Ships and Souldiers of Parma; and under the protection of his Fléet, to bring them into England, and to land his land forces upon Thames ſide.</p>
               <p>The ſixtéenth day (ſaith the relator) there was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> 
                  <note place="margin">The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Navy the ſecond time ſcattered.</note> a great calme, and a thicke cloud was upon the Sea till noone: then the North winde blowing roughly, and again the Weſt winde till midnight, and after that the Eaſt; the Spaniſh Navy was ſcattered, and hardly gathered together untill they came within the ſight of England the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téenth day of Iuly. Upon which day the Lord Admirall was certified by Flemming (who had béene a Pyrate) that the Spaniſh Fléet was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Engliſh Sea, which the Mariners <note place="margin">Flemming a Pyrate diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh fleet to the Engliſh.</note> call the Channell, and was diſcryed neere to the Liſard. The Lord Admirall brought forth the Engliſh Fléet into the Sea, but not without great difficulty, by the ſkill, labour, and alacrity of the ſouldiers and mariners, every one labouring; yea the Lord Admirall himſelfe put his hand to this worke.</p>
               <p>The next day the Engliſh Fléet viewed the <note place="margin">The faſhion of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh fleet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> Spaniſh Fléet comming along with Towers like Caſtles in height, her front crooked like the faſhion of the Moone, the hornes of the front were extended one from the other about ſeven miles, or as ſome ſay eight miles aſunder, ſailing with the labour of the windes, the Ocean as it were groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning under it; their ſaile was but ſlow, and yet at full ſaile before the winde. The Engliſh were willing to let them hold on their courſe, and when they were paſſed by, got behind them, and ſo got the help of the winde.</p>
               <p>Upon the one and twentieth of Iuly, the Lord Admirall of England ſent a Pinace before, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Defiance, to denounce the battell by ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off ſome péeces. And being himſelfe in the Arch-Royall (the, Engliſh Pretorian ſhip or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall) he ſet upon a ſhip which he tooke to be the Spaniſh Admirall, but it was the ſhip of Alfon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Leva. Upon that he beſtowed much ſhot. Preſently Drake, Hawkins, and Forbiſher came <note place="margin">The firſt fight</note> in upon the Spaniſh hindmoſt ſhips which Rical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus governed. Upon theſe they thundred. Rical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus laboured as much as lay in him to ſtay his men, who fled away in their Navy, untill his ſhip beaten and much battered with many ſhot hardly recovered the Fléet. Then the Duke Medina ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together his diſſipated Fléet, and ſetting up more ſaile, held on their courſe, Indéed they could doe no other, for the Engliſh had gotten the advantage of winde, and their ſhips were much more nimble, and ready with incredible celerity to come upon the enemy with a full courſe, and then to turne and returne, and be on every ſide at their pleaſure. After a long fight, and that each of them had taken ſome triall, as of their owne cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſo of the Spaniards alſo, the Lord Admirall thought good not to continue the ſame any longer, in regard that forty ſhips were then abſent, which at that inſtant were ſcarce drawne out of Plim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth Haven.</p>
               <p>The night following, Saint Katherine a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſhip, being ſore torne with the fight, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the middeſt of the Navy to be mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Here a great Cantabrian ſhip of Oquenda, wherein was the Treaſurer of the Campe, by force of Gun-powder that had taken fire, was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: yet it was quenched in time by the ſhippes that came to helpe her. Of theſe that came to helpe the fired ſhip, one was a Galeon, in which was Petrus Waldez; the foremaſt of the Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was caught in the tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This was taken by Drake, who ſent Waidez to Dartmouth, and a great ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>viz.</hi> fifty five thouſand duckats, which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed amongſt the ſouldiers. This Waldez comming into Drakes preſence, kiſſed his hand, and told him they had all reſolved to die, if they had not béene ſo happy as to fall into his hands, whom he knew to be noble. That night be was appointed to ſet forth light, but neglected it; and ſome Germane Merchant ſhips comming by that night, he thinking them to be enemies followed them ſo far, that the Engliſh Navy reſted all night when they could ſée no light ſet forth. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he nor the reſt of the Navy finde the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall untill the next day at Even. The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall all the night procéeding with the Beare and the Mary Roſe did carefully follow the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65665:48"/> with watchfulneſſe. The Duke was buſied <note place="margin">Anno 1620.</note> in ordering his Navy. Alfonſus Leva was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to joyne the firſt and laſt companies. Every ſhip had his ſtation aſſigned according to that preſcribed forme which was appointed in Spaine; it was preſent death to forſake his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This done, he ſent Gliclius an Anceani to Parma, which might declare to him in what caſe they were, and left that Cantabrian ſhip of Oquenda to the winde and Sea, having taken out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the money and mariners, and put them in other ſhips. Yet it ſéemeth that he had not care of all: for that Ship the ſame day with fifty Mariners and ſouldiers lamed, and halfe burnt, fell into the hands of the Engliſh, and was carried to Weymuth.</p>
               <p>The thrée and twentieth of the ſoone moneth, the Spaniards having a favourable North winde turned ſailes upon the Engliſh; the Engliſh being much readier in the uſe of their ſhips, fet about a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> compaſſe for the winde, and having gotten advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the winde, they came to the fight on both ſides. They fought a while confuſedly with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſucceſſe: whileſt on the one ſide the Engliſh with great courage delivered the London ſhips which were incloſed about by the Spaniards; on the other ſide the Spaniards by valour fréed Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caldus from the extreme danger he was in: great were the effulminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which by beating of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances were heard this day. But the loſſe (by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> good providence of God) fell upon the Spaniſh ſide, their ſhips being ſo high that the ſhot went over our Engliſh ſhips; and the Engliſh having ſuch a faire mark at their taller ſhips never ſhot in vaine. Amidſt which encounters, Cock an Engliſhman, being caught indéed in the middeſt of the Spaniſh ſhips, could not be recovered, but periſhed, howbeit with great honor he rebenged himſelfe. Thus a long time the Engliſh ſhips with great agility were ſometimes upon the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> giving them the one ſide, and then the other, and preſently were off againe, and ſtill tooke the Sea, to make themſelves ready to come in againe. Whereas the Spaniſh ſhips being of great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then were troubled and hindred, and ſtood to bée markes for the Engliſh Bullets. For all that the Admirall would not admit the Engliſh to <note place="margin">The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall would not ſuffer his ſhips to come to grapple with the Spaniſh.</note> come to boord their ſhips, becauſe they had a full army in their ſhips, which he had not; their ſhips were many in number, and greater, and higher, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> that if they had come to grapple, as ſome would have had if, the Engliſh being much lower then the Spaniſh ſhips muſt néeds have had the worſt of them that fought from the higher ſhips. And if the Engliſh had béen overcome, the loſſe would have béen greater than the victory could have béen; for ours being overcome would have put the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in hazard.</p>
               <p>The foure and twentieth day of Iuly they gave over fighting on both ſides. The Admirall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> ſent ſome ſmall Barkes to the next Engliſh ſhore, to ſupply the proviſion; And divided all his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy into foure ſquadrons: The firſt whereof was under his owne government; the next Drake governed; the third Hawkins; the laſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſher. And he appointed out of every ſquadron certaine little ſhips, which on divers ſides might ſet upon the Spaniards in the night, but a ſudden calme tooke them, and ſo that advice was without effect.</p>
               <p>The five and twentieth day, being S. Iames <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> 
                  <note place="margin">The third fight.</note> day, S. Anne the Galeon of Portugall, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to hold courſe with the reſt, was ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by ſome ſmall Engliſh ſhips. To whoſe aide came in Leva, and Didacus Telles Enrigues with thrée Galeaſſes: which the Admirall and the Lord Thomas Howard eſpying, made in againſt the Galeaſſes (the calme was ſo great that they were drawne in by boats with cords) and did ſo beat upon the Galeaſſes with great ſhot, that with much adoe, and not without great loſſe, they hardly recovered the Galeon. The Spaniards reported that the Admirall of Spaine was that day in the hindmoſt company, and being come néerer the Engliſh ſhips then before, was ſore beaten with the Engliſh great Ordnance, many men flaine in her, her great maſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. And after that the Admirall of Spaine, accompanied with Ricaldus and others, did ſet upon the Engliſh Admirall, who by the benefit of the winde ſuddenly turning eſcaped. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards hold on their courſe againe, and ſend to the Duke of Parma, that with all ſpéed he ſhould joyne his ſhips with the Kings Fléet.

This great Spaniſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madoe was ſo far from being eſtéemed Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the opinions of the Engliſh, that many yong men and Gentlemen, in hope to be partakers of a famous victory againſt the Spaniards, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſhips of their owne charges, and joyned themſelves to the Engliſh Fléet; among whom were the Earles of Eſſex, of Northumberland, of <note place="margin">Noblemen and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men joyne with the fleet.</note> Cumberland, Thomas and Robert Cecilles, Henry Brookes, William Hatton, Robert Cary, Ambroſe Willoughby, Thomas Gerard, Arthur Gorge, and other Gentlemen of good note and quality.</p>
               <p>The ſeven and twentieth day at Even, the <note place="margin">Purpoſing to execute their deſigne on fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 12. of Auguſt, the night being dark, but how happily the ſame was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, reade the next ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on following.</note> Spainards caſt anchor néere to Calis, being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of their ſkilfull Sea-men, that if they went any further, they might be indangered by force of that tide to be driven into the North Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Néere to them ſtood the Engliſh Admirall with his Fléet within a great Guns ſhot. To the Admirall Seimor and Winter now joyne their ſhips; ſo that now there were an hundred and forty ſhips in the Engliſh Fléet, able and well furniſhed for fight, for ſaile, and to turne which way was néedfull: and yet there were but fiftéen of theſe which bore the burden of the battell and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed the enemy. The Spaniard, as often he had done before, ſo now with great earneſtneſſe ſent to the Duke of Parma to ſend forty flie boats, without the which they could not fight with the Engliſh, becauſe of the greatneſſe and ſlowneſſe of their owne ſhips, and the agility of the Engliſh ſhips: And intreating him by all meanes now to come to Sea with his army, which army was now to be protected as it were under the wings of the Spaniſh Annadoe, untill they tooke land in England.</p>
               <p>But the Duke was unprovided, and could not come out at an inſtant. The broad ſhippes with flat bottomes being then full of chinkes muſt bée mended. Victuals wanted and muſt be provided. The Mariners being long kept againſt their wills beganne to ſhrinke away. The Ports of Dunkerke and Nieuport, by which he muſt bring his army to the ſea, were now ſo beſet with the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65665:48"/> ſtrong ſhips of Holland and Zealand, which were <note place="margin">Anno 1588.</note> furniſhed with great and ſmall munition, that he was not able to come to Sea, unleſſe he would come upon his owne apparent deſtruction, and caſt himſelfe and his men wilfully into a head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long danger. Yet he omitted nothing that might be done, being a man eager and induſtrious, and inflamed with a deſire of overcomming Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>

The ſhip and Ordnance fell to the ſhare of the Governour of Calts.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards report, that the Duke when he ſaw the fiery ſhips comming commanded all the fléet to pull up their anchors, but ſo, as the danger being paſt, every ſhip might return again to his ſtation: and he himſelfe returned, giving a ſigne to the reſt by ſhooting off a Gun; which was heard but of a few, for they were far off ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſome into the open Ocean, ſome through feare were driven upon the ſhallowes of the coaſt of Flanders.</p>

Sir Robert Sidney was ſent to him when the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh fléet was comming, to congratulate and to give him thankes for his propenſe affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the maintenance of the common cauſe; and to declare how ready ſhe would be to help him if the Spaniards ſhould land in Scotland; and that he might recall to memory with what ſtrange am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition the Spaniard had gaped for all Britaine, urging the Pope to excommunicate him, to the end that he might be thruſt from the Kingdome of Scotland, and from the ſucceſſion in England: and to give him notice of threatning of Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza and the Popes Nuncio, who threatned his ruine if they could worke it; and therefore war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to take eſpeciall héed to the Scottiſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</p>
                  <p>The King pleaſantly anſwered, That he looked for no other benefit from the Spaniard, then that which Polyphemus promiſed to Vlyſſes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure him laſt after all his Fellowes were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Anno 1598.</note> 
                  <hi>the third King of France.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT was not long after that the Duke of Guiſe, who was ſlain by the Lord Lougna at the kings Chamber doore, and King Henry the third were taken away; he being the laſt of the houſe of Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois, and dying without any lawfull heires of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> body begotten.</p>
               <p>The manner of whoſe death was thus. A Frier of the Order of Saint Dominicke, called Iames Clement, pretended hee had matters of great conſequence to impart to the King: who being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into his preſence, upon his knées preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the King with a Letter which he drew out of one ſléeve; which whilſt the King attentively read, the Frier pulled forth a poyſoned knife out of his other ſléeve, wherewith he ſtabbed the King into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the lower part of his belly. The King féeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hurt therewith, ſnaching it out of the wound, ſtrucke the ſame into the Friers eye, who haſting to get away, the King crying out, His Lords and Gentlemen perceiving what the Frier had done, ſlew him preſently with rapiers and ſwords. The King before hee died, having raigned fourtéene yeares and ſeven moneths, called for the King of Navarre, all the Princes, Lords and Noblemen, that were in his campe, and declared that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> King of Navarre was the true lawfull heire to the Crowne of France; willing them all to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him for their King, and that notice ſhould likewiſe be given throughout all his camp and Kingdome alſo.</p>
               <p>Thus the ſoveraigne Iudge of the world made <note place="margin">The raigne of Henry the fourth over the kingdome of France.</note> way for the entrance of Henry the fourth to have dominion over the Kingdome of France. Now howſoever from the yeare 1589. to this preſent yeare 1598. the Churches of Chriſt have ſéene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> marvellous changes, and how the league for a time made many furious onſets: yet it pleaſed God ſo to moderate things, that the faithfull were preſerved from being perſecuted; yea, they obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of their Prince many priviledges and favors. For the King in the firſt yeres of his raigne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the profeſſion of the true Religion, wherein he had béen bred and brought up, did manfully reſiſt both theſe of the league, and the Spaniards, the great God of battels bleſſing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> right and juſt wars undertaken by this Prince, to the confuſion of all his enemies, till he fell to ſide with Popery; though the affairs of his Kingdome gained but little thereby.</p>

               <head>¶ <hi>The Hiſtory of one Margaret Pierrone, who choſe rather to be burned her ſelfe, than willingly to burne her Bible, Anno</hi> 1593.</head>
               <p>THere was one Margaret Pierrone borne in a village of Cambray called Sanſay, who with her husband retired into the City of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencians. Now becauſe ſhe could not endure the bad qualities of a maid ſervant of hers, ſhee was by her ſaid maid accuſed to the new ſect-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſirnamed the Ieſuites, for that ſhee had not béen in many yeares at the maſſe, as alſo for kéeping in her houſe a Bible, in reading whereof was her whole delight. They acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Magiſtrate herewith, ſhe was by and by apprehended: ſome friends ſent her an inck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof before hand once or twice, that ſhée ſhould get her ſome where out of the way: but the errand was not done, God having a purpoſe that ſhe ſhould beare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vitnes of his truth, to fill up the number of thoſe that were to die for the name of Ieſus.</p>
               <p>Being in priſon, the Iudges calling her before them, ſaid, Margaret, are you not willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home unto your houſe, and there live with your husband and children? Yes ſaith ſhe, if it may ſtand with the good will of God. They added further, that they had ſo wrought with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Ieſuites, that in doing a ſmall matter ſhe might be ſet at liberty, If, ſaith ſhe, it be not a thing contrary to Gods glory and mine owne ſalvation, you ſhall heare what I will ſay. No ſuch thing Margaret, ſaid they: for a ſcaffold ſhall be erected in the chiefe place of the City, upon which you are to preſent your ſelf, and there to crave pardon for your offending the Law; then a fire being kindled, you muſt caſt your bible therein to bee conſumed, without ſpeaking any word at all.</p>
               <p>I pray you my maſters tell me, ſaith ſhee, Is my Bible a good booke, or no? Yes, we confeſſe it is, ſaid they, If you allow it to be good, ſaid the woman, why would you have me caſt it into the fire? Only ſaid they, to give the Ieſuits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Imagine it to be but paper that you burne, and then all is well enough, doe ſo much for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your life, and we will meddle no more with you; you may buy you another when you will.</p>
               <p>They ſpent about two houres in perſwading her hereunto, ſhewing how ſhe might doe a leſſe evill, that a greater good might come of it. By the help of God, ſaith ſhee, I will never conſent to doe it. What would the people ſay, when they ſée me burne my Bible? will they not exclaime and ſay, yonder is a wretched woman indéed, that will burne the Bible wherein are contained all the Articles of our Chriſtian faith? I will burne my body ſure, before that I will burne my Bible.</p>
               <p>Then ſéeing ſhe would in no ſort conforme her ſelfe either to the will of the Ieſuites, or to theirs, they cauſed her to be committed cloſe priſoner, and to be fed only with bread and water, none to be permitted ſo much as to ſpeake unto her, thinking by this hard uſage to overcome her: but all was to no purpoſe. Being thus long ſhut up, and no newes heard of her one way or other, every one imagned that they had put her to death privily.

               <p>But on Wedneſday the two and twentieth of Ianuary 1593. ſhee was condemned to be brought upon a ſtage ſet up in the Market place before the towne-houſe, there to ſée her books burnt; then her ſelfe to be ſtrangled at a poſt, and her body drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> to the dunghill without the City. Shee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the place, and aſcending the Scaffold, diſtinctly pronounced the Lords Prayer.

               </head>
               <p>IN the yeare 1595. about the end of May there was executed a young man at Rome about the age of five and twenty yeares, who went into the Church of Magdalen, where beholding their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, being pricked forward with religious zeale and conſtant reſolution, not being able to endure the ſight of thoſe horrible impieties which were there committed amongſt them: As the Biſhop was ſetting forward to goe on proceſſion, this young man directed his way towards the Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> porch: and as the proceſſion began to paſſe forward he waited till the Biſhop came that bare the Hoſt, and in his going forth ſtepped to the pixe, pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out of his hands, threw it to the ground, ſaying aloud, ye wretched Idolaters, doe ye fall downe to a morſell of bread? The people preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell fell upon the young man; yet without touching his perſon, notwithſtanding the great ſtirre they made, he was from thence ſent to priſon to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitoll. Complaint being made thereof to Pope <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> Clement the eighth touching all that which had happened; He preſently ordained that he which had done it ſhould be burned the ſame day, for an example and terrour to all his companions. But ſome of the Popes Cardinals being then at hand, adviſed that he ſhould be detained rather a while in priſon, to be examined by all exquiſite tortures, to make him confeſſe his fellowes, and who had ſet him on. Having kept him eight daies in priſon, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be drawne from him, but this ſpeech, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> 
                  <hi>Such was the will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they ſaw they could not prevaile, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement was framed, and his ſentence regiſtred, namely that he was to paſſe from the Capitoll, naked unto his middle, and to weare on his head the forme of a Devill, or Dragon, his breeches painted all over with flames of fire, and thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound in a cart, to be burned alive, being firſt carried in this manner about the City.</p>
               <p>The Patient underſtanding how he was to be handled, lifting up his eies, implored helpe from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> the Almighty; and ſéeing how he was derided of all, continued in his devotion and prayers. He could not refraine from uttering ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the life of the Cardinals and their aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, who hearing it, began to be in a rage, and that he might no longer bewray their wickedneſſe, they cauſed a great gagge to be forced into his mouth, which vexed him more then all the reſt, when he teſtified, ſaying, How ſhall I call upon my God? But he patiently ſubmitted himſelfe to endure all their cruelties,</p>
               <p>In this plight he was brought to Magdalens, where he had caſt downe the Idoll, and there one of the hangmen cut off his hand before the doore: at which the patient being not much moved, his hand being ſet on a pole in the cart, the two tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors made him féele the force of the fire, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king each of them a great torch in his hand fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, with which they ſcortched and burned his fleſh through all the city of Rome.</p>
               <p>At length they arrived at the place called <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio de Pior,</hi> by which time the young man was brought into a pittifull caſe, being ſcortched all over his body, all bliſtered, and bloudy, having nothing whole but his head, which he now and then lifted up.</p>
               <p>Being taken downe out of the cart, and ſéeing the poſt whereunto he was to be faſtened with thrée chaines of yron; he went of himſelfe to the poſt, and falling on his knées kiſſed the chaines with which he was there to be bound till the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſhould be ended.</p>
               <p>But before the fire was put to him, he was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Friers and Prieſts to worſhip an Idoll which they preſented there before him. From which turning away his face, he ſhewed unto them his conſtant reſolution to the contrary, holding on his Chriſtian courſe unto the end: which he truly teſtified; for as ſoone as the flames of fire ſeiſed on him, bowing his head hee quietly yéelded up his ſoule into the hands of God.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN the yeare 1601. Bartholomew Copin of the valley of Luſerne reſorted unto a place called Aſt in Piemont, with certaine merchandiſe, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to vent the ſame at a Faire there, which was to be kept the day following. It ſo fell out, that ſitting at ſupper in the evening with ſundry other Merchants, one amongſt the reſt began to uſe ſome ſpéech about the diverſitios of Religions, and there withall ſpake ſomethin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> tending to the diſgrace of thoſe of the valleyes of Angrougne and the neighbour villages.</p>
               <p>Copin hearing ſuch ſpéeches caſt forth againſt his Brethren, as he little expected from men of that ſort, and alſo againſt their Religion, all which tended to the diſhonour of God; hee feared leſt it ſhould be offenſively taken, if he ſhould not make ſome reply unto thoſe blaſphemies which he heard with his, eares, and ſo anſwer him who held ſuch a diſcourſe againſt the religion which himſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. He who reproved Copin asked, Are you
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65665:50"/> one of Vandois? He anſwered, yes I am. And <note place="margin">Anno 1601.</note> what? ſaid the other, beléeve you not that God is in the Hoſt? No, ſaid Copin. Oh, ſaid the other, ſée how falſe your Religion is? My religion, ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin, is no leſſe true then God is God, and as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine as I am ſure to die.</p>
               <p>The next day Copin was called before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Aſt, who told him that report had béen made to him of ſome offenſive ſpéeches which hee had uſed the night paſt in his lodging: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> it behoved him now to acknowledge his fault, if he meant to obtaine pardon for the ſame, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he muſt looke to be chaſtiſed according to his demerits.</p>
               <p>Copin anſwered, he had uttered nothing, but that which he was firſt provided to ſpeake; nor had he ſaid ought, but what he was reſolved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the hazard of his life. He affirmed that God had beſtowed upon him ſome worldly goods, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> alſo a wife and children, but that he was not ſo glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his affection to any of them, but he could bee <note place="margin">Luke 9 23.</note> content to forgoe them all, rather than the peace of a good conſcience.</p>
               <p>As touching his carriage and behaviour, if it pleaſed him, he ſaid, to make enquiry thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Merchants of Aſt, they could all reſolve him as touching his honeſt dealing: who alſo hee knew would witneſſe with him, that hee had wronged none in all that time hee had converſed among them. And inaſmuch as he was a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> traffiquing in and about his lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he ought to be diſmiſſed and to be no further moleſted. For if it were lawfull for Iewes and Turkes to trade in Faires and Markets, and to uſe commerce throughout Piemont; that favor ought much more to be permitted unto him who was a Chriſtian. And as touching the matter of Religion, whereabout he was accuſed, he medled not at all therewith for his owne particular, but had queſtions propounded to him concerning the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſame by others: in which regard leave was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to anſwer and to yéeld a reaſon of his faith in any place, to any whomſoever they were that ſhould aske what he thought of the ſame: yea, liberty was granted even by his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to thoſe of the Valleyes of Vandoyes to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer any man to a queſtion demanded; provided that hee? procéeded not to, teach and inſtruct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop regarded none of theſe allegations, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> but commanded he ſhould be put into priſon. The next day the Biſhops Secretary came to viſite Copin, teſtifying how much good will hee bore him; adviſing him as a friend, that if he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged not his fault, he was in great danger of his life.</p>
               <p>Copin anſwered, that his life was in the hands <note place="margin">Pſal. 89. 47, 48.</note> of God, and that he would never ſéeke to ſave it to the prejudice of Gods glory: alſo, that he had not above two or thrée turnes to fetch here in this world, before he arrived in heaven; and therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> prayed God ſo to aſſiſt him by his grace, that hee might never leave the ſtrait way which leadeth thereto.</p>
               <p>A few dayes after hee was examined by a Monke, who was an Inquiſitor, in the preſence of the Biſhop, who vexed him a long while with his ſugred diſcourſe, and by faire words endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to draw him to abjure his Religion. But Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin reſiſted him ſtill by the holy Scriptures; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> that if he ſhould now be aſhamed of Chriſt <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 38.</note> and deny him, Chriſt might juſtly be aſhamed of him, and utterly deny him before his heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The Monke finiſhed his diſpute with this dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged farewell, <hi>Away thou curſed Lutherane, thou ſhalt goe to all the Devils in hell; and when thou commeſt to be tormented amongſt thoſe uncleane ſpirits, then wilt thou remember theſe holy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions which wee have tendred unto thee for the ſaving of thy ſoule, but thou haddeſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goe to hell, than to reconcile thy ſelfe to thy holy Mother the Church.</hi> It is not long ſince, ſaid Copin, that I was reconciled to the true Church.</p>
               <p>After many violent aſſaults they gave way for his wife to come unto him, and with her one of his ſons, promiſing them to ſet him at liberty to goe home with them, if hee would make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for his fault committed, by acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the ſame. They gave his ſon and wife leave, to this purpoſe, to ſtay ſupper with him in priſon: during which time he uſed many exhor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ations ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to patience; albeit the wife ſhould depart to her houſe without an husband, or the child with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his father: for be you well aſſured, ſaid her, that God will be a better husband and a father unto you than ever I was or can be. For his owne part, he ſaid, he was not bound to love wife or children more then Chriſt: beſides, they had cauſe to rejoyce, and to think him happy, that God would honor him ſo farre as to beare witneſſe to his truth with the loſſe of his life, and hoped, hee ſaid, that God would be ſo favorable to him, as to ſupport him under any torments he was to endure for his glories ſake.</p>
               <p>In concluſion hee commended his ſonne and one daughter to his wives care, which God had given them in the married eſtate; charging her againe and againe to ſée them brought up vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and in the feare of God. He charged his ſonne to obey his mother, ſo ſhould he be made partaker of the promiſed bleſſing. He intreated them both to pray, for him, that God would fortifie him againſt all temptations. And thus having bleſſed his ſon, and taken leave of his wife, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted out of the priſon, and he ſhut up as hee was before.</p>
               <p>The woman and her ſon were diſſolved into teares, ſighing and crying out, that it would have moved the ſtonieſt heart to compaſſion: but this holy man, not contenting himſelfe with that hee had ſaid to them by word of mouth, writ unto his wife this Letter enſuing, the originall whereof ſhe hath exhibited to us, written and ſigned with the hand of the ſaid Copin, the inſcription thus fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

               <p>The Biſhop of Aſt was ſomewhat troubled about this his priſoner; for if he had let him go, he feared it would bréed ſome ſcandall, and many might thereby be emboldned to open their mouths wide againſt the Romane religion. Beſides, there was a clauſe in the Contract made betwéene his Excellency and the people of Vandois, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted thoſe of the religion from offence, in theſe words; And if it ſhall fall out that they be asked <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> or queſtioned withall in Piemont, about the cauſe of Religion, by any of his excellencies ſubjects, it ſhall be lawfull for thoſe of the ſaid Religion to anſwer without ſuffering any penall or perſonall puniſhment for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now Copin had a queſtion put to him, in which reſpect he ought to have béen cléered. But the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop would by no meanes heare that hee had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And therefore did the Earle of Salisbury conclude with the Lord Mountegle, that he would in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Kings abſence impart the ſame Letter to ſome more of his Majeſties Counſell; whereof my Lord Mountegle liked well: only adding this requeſt by way of proteſtation, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the event hereof might prove, it ſhould not be imputed to him, as procéeding from too light and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> too ſuddaine an apprehenſion, that he delivered this Letter, being only moved thereunto for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of his ready devotion and care for preſervation of his Majeſty and the State.

                  <hi>MY Lord, out of the love I beare to ſome of your friends, I have a care of your preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Therefore, I would adviſe you as you tender your life, to deviſe ſome excuſe to ſhift off your attendance at this Parliament. For God and man have concurred to puniſh the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of this time. And thinke nor ſlightly of this advertiſement, but retire your ſelfe into your country, where you may expect the event in ſafety. For though there be no apparance of any ſtir, yet I ſay, they ſhall receive a terrible blow this Parliament, and yet they ſhall not ſee who hurts them. This counſell is not to be contemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may doe you good, and can doe you no harme; for the danger is paſt ſo ſoone as you have burnt the Letter. And I hope God will give you the grace to make good uſe of it: To whoſe holy protection I commend you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King no ſooner read the Letter, but after a little pauſe, and then reading it over againe, hée <note place="margin">His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Letter.</note> delivered his judgement of it in ſuch ſort, as hée thought it was not to be contemned, for that the ſtile of it ſéemed to be more quicke, and pithy, then is uſuall to be in any Paſquill, or Libell (the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities of idle braines.) But the Earle of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury perceiving the King to apprehend it déep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier then he looked for, knowing his nature, told him that he thought by one ſentence in it, that it was like to be written by ſome foole or mad man, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him this ſentence in it, <hi>For the danger is paſt ſo ſoone as you have burnt the Letter,</hi> which he ſaid was like to be the ſaying of a foole: for if the danger was paſt ſo ſoone as the Letter was burnt, then the warning behooved to be of little availe, when the burning of the letter might make the danger to be eſchewed. But the King on the contrary conſidering the former ſentence in the Letter, <hi>That they ſhould receive a terrible blow at this Parliament, and yet ſhould not ſee who hurt them,</hi> Ioining it to the ſentence immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">A terrible blow indeed; at once to have wracked King, Queen, Prince, and Progeny, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, State, and all.</note> following, already alledged, did thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, That the danger mentioned ſhould bée ſome ſuddaine danger by blowing up of powder: For no other inſurrection, rebellion, or whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver other private and deſperate attempt could bée committed or attempted in time of Parliament, and the Authors thereof unſéene, except onely it were by a blowing up of Powder, which might be performed by one baſe knave in a darke corner; whereupon he was moved to interpret and conſtrue the latter ſentence in the Letter (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Earle of Salisbury) againſt all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſence and conſtruction in Grammar, as if by theſe words, <hi>For the danger is paſt ſo ſoone as you have burnt the Letter,</hi> ſhould be cloſely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the ſuddainty and quickneſſe of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which ſhould be as quickly performed and at an end, as that Paper ſhould be blazing up in the fire; turning that word of As ſoone, to the ſence of, As quickly: and therefore wiſhed, that <note place="margin">His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties opinion for ſearching of the under roomes of the Parliament houſe.</note> before his going to the Parliament, the under roomes of the Parliament houſe might be well and narrowly ſearched. But the Earle of Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury wondering at this his Majeſties commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, which he knew to be ſo far contrary to his ordinary and naturall diſpoſition, who did rather ever ſin upon the other ſide, in not apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor truſting due advertiſement of practiſes and perils when he was truly informed of them, whereby he had many times drawne himſelfe into many deſperate dangers: and interpreting right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this extraordinary Caution at this time to procéed from the vigilant care he had of the whole State, more then of his owne perſon, which could not but have all periſhed together, if this deſignement had ſuccéeded: He thought good to diſſemble ſtill unto the King, that there had béene any juſt cauſe of ſuch apprehenſion; and ending the purpoſe with ſome merry jeſt on this ſubject, as his cuſtome is, tooke his leave for that time. But though he ſéemed ſo to neglect it to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, yet his cuſtomable and watchfull care of the King and the State ſtill bolling within him; And
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65665:52"/> having with the bleſſed Virgin Mary laid up in <note place="margin">Anno 1605.</note> his heart the Kings ſo ſtrange judgement and conſtruction of it; he could not be at reſt till hée acquainted the foreſaid Lords what had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and him in private.</p>
               <p>Whereupon they were all ſo earneſt to renew againe the memory of the ſame purpoſe unto his Majeſty, as it was agréed that he ſhould the next day, being Saturday, repaire to his Highneſſe: which he did in the ſaid privy Gallery, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the memory thereof, the Lord Chamberlaine <note place="margin">The determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſearch the Parliament houſe and the rooius under it</note> then being preſent with the King. At what time it was determined, That the ſaid L. Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine ſhould, according to his cuſtome and office, view all the parliament houſes, both above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and conſider what likelihood or appearance of any ſuch danger might poſſibly be gathered by the ſight of them: but yet, as well for ſtaying of idle rumors, as for being the more able to diſcern any myſtery, the nearer that things were in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> his journey thither was ordained to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred till the afternoone before the ſitting downe of the Parliament, which was upon the Munday following. At what time he (according to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion) went to the Parliament houſe, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with my Lord Mountegle, being in zeale to the Kings ſervice earneſt and curious to ſée the event of that accident whereof he had the fortune to be the firſt diſcoverer: where, having viewed all <note place="margin">Wood and coale found by the L. Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine in the Vault.</note> the lower roomes, he found in the vault under the upper houſe great ſtore and proviſion of bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> fagois, and coales: and inquiring of Why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neard kéeper of the Wardrobe, to what uſe he had put thoſe lower roomes and cellars; he told him that Thomas Percy had hired both the houſe and part of the Cellar or Vault under the ſame, and that the wood and coale, under which were hidden thirty ſixe barrels of powder great and ſmall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides great barres of Iron, péeces of Timber, and maſſie ſtones covered over with Fagots <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> therein, was the ſaid Gentlemans owne proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whereupon the Lord Chamberlaine, caſting his eye aſide, perceived a fellow ſtanding in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner there, calling himſelfe the ſaid Percies man, and kéeper of that houſe for him, but indéed was Guido Fawkes, the owner of that hand which ſhould have acted that monſtrous and helliſh Tragedy.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chamberlaine looking upon all things with a héedfull indéed, yet in outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance with but a careleſſe and reckleſſe eye, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> (as became ſo wiſe and diligent a miniſter) he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently addreſſed himſelfe to the King in the privy Gallery, where in the preſence of the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, the Lord Admirall, the Earles of Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Northampton, and Saliſbury he made his report, what he had ſéen and obſerved there; noting <note place="margin">The Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines report and judgment of what he had obſerved in the ſearch.</note> that Montegle had told him, That he no ſooner heard Thomas Percy named to be the poſſeſſor of that houſe, but conſidering both his backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Religion, and the old deareneſſe in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> friendſhip betwéene himſelfe and the ſaid Percy, he did greatly ſuſpect the matter, and that the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould come from him. The ſaid Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine alſo told, That he did not wonder a little at the extraordinary great proviſion of wood and coale in that houſe, where Thomas Percy had ſo ſeldome occaſion to remaine; as likewiſe it gave him in his minde that this man looked like a very tall and deſperate fellow.</p>
               <p>This could not but increaſe the Kings former <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> apprehenſion and jealouſie: whereupon he inſiſted (as before) that the houſe was narrowly to be ſearched, and that thoſe billets and coales would be ſearched to the bottom, it being moſt ſuſpitious that they were laid there onely for covering of the powder. Of this ſame minde alſo were all the Counſellors then preſent. But upon the faſhion of making of the ſearch was it long debated: for upon the one ſide they were all ſo jealous of the <note place="margin">Diſputation about the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſearch.</note> Kings ſafety, that they all agréed, that there could not be too much caution uſed for preventing his danger. And yet upon the other part they were all extream loath and dainty, that in caſe this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould prove to be nothing but the evaporation of an idle brain; then a curious ſearch being made, and nothing found, ſhould not only turne to the generall ſcandall of the King and the State, as being ſo ſuſpitious of every light and frivolous toy, but likewiſe lay in ill favoured imputation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earle of Northumberland one of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties greateſt ſubjects and Counſellors, this Thomas Percy being his kinſman and moſt confident familiar. And the rather were they cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious upon this point, knowing how far the King deteſted to be thought ſuſpitious or jealous of any of his good ſubjects, though of the meaneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée. And therefore though they all agréed upon the main ground, which was to provide for the ſecurity of the Kings perſon, yet did they much differ in the circumſtances, by which this action might be beſt carried with leaſt dinne and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſlander. But the King himſelfe ſtill perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there were divers ſhrewd appearances, and that a narrow ſearch of thoſe places could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge no man that was innocent, he at laſt plainly reſolved them, that either muſt all the parts of thoſe roomes be narrowly ſearched, and no poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of danger left unexamined, or elſe he and they all muſt reſolve not to meddle in it at all, but plainly to goe the next day to the Parliament, and leave the ſucceſſe to Fortune; which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeved they would be loth to take upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: for in ſuch a caſe as this, an halfe doing was worſe than no doing at all. Whereupon it was at laſt concluded, That nothing ſhould bée <note place="margin">Agreed that the ſearch ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of ſeeking for Wardrobe ſtuffe miſſed by Whyneard</note> left unſearched in thoſe houſes: and yet for the better colour and ſtay of rumour, in caſe nothing were found, it was thought méet, that upon a pretence of Whyneards miſſing ſome of the Kings ſtuffe or hangings which he had in kéeping all theſe roomes ſhould be narrowly ripped for them. And to this purpoſe was Sir Thomas Knevet (a Gèntleman of his Majeſties privy Chamber) imployed, being a Iuſtice of Peace in Weſtminſter, and one, of whoſe ancient fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty both the late Quéen and our now Soveraigne have had large proofe: who, according to the truſt committed unto him, went about the midnight next after to the Parliament houſe, accompanied with ſuch a ſmall number as was fit for that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. But before his entry into the houſe, finding <note place="margin">Faux found at midnight without the houſe.</note> Thomas Percies alledged man ſtanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the doores, his clothes and bootes on at ſo dead a time of the night, he reſolved to apprehend him, as he did, and afterward went forward to the ſearching of the houſe: where after he had cauſed to be overturned ſome of the billets and coales, he firſt found one of the ſmall barrels of powder, and after all the reſt, to the number of thirty ſixe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, great and ſmall. And thereafter ſearching the fellow whom he had taken, found thrée mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and all other inſtruments fit for blowing up the Powder, ready upon him, which made him inſtantly confeſſe his own guiltineſſe, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring alſo unto him, That if he had happened to be within the houſe when he tooke him, as hée was immediatly before (at the ending of his worke) he would not have failed to have blowne him up, houſe and all.</p>
               <p>Thus after Sir Thomas had cauſed the wretch to be ſurely bound, and well guarded by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he had brought with him, he himſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back to the Kings Palace, and gave war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his ſucceſſe to the Lord Chamberlaine, and Earle of Salisbury; who immediatly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65665:52"/> the reſt of the Counſell that lay in the houſe, as ſoone as they could get themſelves ready, came with their fellow Counſellors to the Kings B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d chamber, being at that time néere foure of the clock in the morning. And at the firſt entry of the Kings chamber doore, the Lord Chamberlaine, being not any longer able to conceale his joy for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of ſo great a danger, told the King in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed haſte, that all was found and diſcovered, and the Traitor in hands and faſt bound.</p>
               <p>Then, order being firſt taken for ſending for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> reſt of the Counſell that lay in the towne, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner himſelfe was brought into the houſe, where in reſpect of the ſtrangeneſſe of the accident, no man was ſtaid from the ſight or ſpeaking with him. And within a while after the Counſell did examine him; who ſéeming to put on a Romane reſolution, did both to the Counſell and to every other perſon that ſpake with him that day, appeare ſo. conſtant and ſetled upon his grounds, as wée <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> all thought we had found ſome new Mutius Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vola borne in England; for notwithſtanding the horror of the fact, the guilt of his conſcience, his ſudden ſurpriſing, the terror which ſhould have béen ſtricken in him by comming into the preſence of ſo grave a Counſell, and the reſtleſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed queſtions that every man all that day did vexe him with; yet was his countenance ſo far from being dejected, as he often ſmiled in ſcornfull manner, not only avowing the fact, but repenting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> only, with the ſaid Scevola, his failing in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof, whereof he ſaid the Devill and not God was the diſcoverer; anſwering quickly to every mans objection, ſcoffing at any idle que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions which were propounded to him, and jeſting at ſuch as he thought had no authority to examine him.</p>
               <p>All that day could the Counſell get nothing out of him touching his complices, refuſing to anſwer to any ſuch queſtions as he thought might diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the plot, and laying all the blame upon himſelf; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> whereunto he ſaid he was moved only for religion and conſcience ſake, denying the King to be his lawfull Soveraigne, or the annointed of God, in reſpect he was an heretique; and giving himſelfe no other name then Iohn Iohnſon, ſervant to Thomas Percy. But the next morning being carried to the Tower of London, he did not there remaine above two or thrée daies, being twice or thrice in that ſpace re-examined, and the rack only <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> offered and ſhewed unto him, when the maſke of his Romane fortitude did viſibly begin to weare and ſlide off his face; and then did he begin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe part of the truth, and thereafter to open the whole matter, as doth appeare by his depoſitions immediatly following.</p>

And this was firſt propounded unto me about Eaſter laſt was twelve moneth, beyond the Seas, in the Low-Countries of the Archdukes obeiſance, by Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Winter, who came thereupon with me into England, and there we imparted our purpoſe to thrée other Gentlemen more, namely, Robert Cateſby, Thomas Perty, and Iohn Wright: who all five conſulting together of the meanes how to execute the ſame, and taking a vow among our ſelves for ſecrecy (which vow was this, You ſhall ſweare by the bleſſed Trinity, and by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you now purpoſe to receive, never to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe, directly or indirectly, by word or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the matter that ſhall be propoſed to you to kéep ſecret; nor deſiſt from the execution thereof untill the reſt ſhall give you leave: after which, being confeſſed, and receiving abſolution, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned received the Sacrament thereupon, by the hands of Gerrard the Ieſuite there preſent) Cateſby propounded to have it performed by Gun-powder, and by making a Mine under the upper houſe of Parliament: Which place wée made choiſe of the rather, becauſe Religion having béen unjuſtly ſuppreſſed there, it was fitteſt that juſtice and puniſhment ſhould be executed there.</p>
               <p>This being reſolved amongſt us, Thomas Percy hired a houſe at Weſtminſter for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, néere adjoyning to the Parliament houſe, and there we begun to make our Mine about the 11. of December, 1604.</p>

               <p>When we came to the very foundation of the wall of the houſe, which was about thrée yards thick, and found it a matter of great difficulty, we tooke unto us another Gentleman, Robert Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in like manner with oath and Sacrament as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>It was about Chriſtmaſſe when we brought our Mine unto the wall, and about Candlemaſſe we had wrought the wall halfe through; and whileſt they were in working I ſtood as ſentinel to deſcry any man that came néere, whereof I gave them warning, and ſo they ceaſed untill I gave notice againe to procéed.</p>
               <p>All we ſeven lay in the houſe, having ſhot and powder; being reſolved to die in that place, before we ſhould yéeld or be taken.</p>
               <p>As they were working upon the wall, they heard a ruſhing in a cellar of removing of Coles, whereupon we feared we had béen diſcovered, and they ſent me to goe to the cellar; who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Coles were a ſelling, and that the cellar was to be let, viewing the commodity thereof for our purpoſe, Percy went and hired the ſame for yéerely rent.</p>
               <p>We had before this provided and brought into the houſe twenty barrels of Powder, which we removed into the. Cellar, and covered the ſame with billets and fagots, which were provided for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>About Eaſter, the Parliament being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued till October next, we diſperſed our ſelves, and I retired into the Low-Countries, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and direction of the reſt, as well to acquaint Owen with the particulars of the plot, as alſo leſt by my longer ſtay I might have growne ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſo have come in queſtion.</p>

               <p>It was further reſolved amongſt us, that the ſame day that this act ſhould have béen performed, ſome other of our Confederates ſhould have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed the perſon of the Lady Elizabeth the Kings eldeſt Daughter, who was kept in Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire at the Lord Harringtons houſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently

                  <p>NOt out of hope to obtaine pardon; for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my temporall part, I may ſay, The fault is greater then can be forgiven; nor affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting here the title of a good ſubject; for I muſt redéeme my Countrey from as great a danger, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> as I have hazarded the bringing of her into, before I can purchaſe any ſuch opinion: only at your honors command I will briefly ſet downe mine owne accuſation, and how far I have procéeded in this buſineſſe, which I ſhall the faithfullier doe, ſince I ſée ſuch courſes are not pleaſing to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and that all, or the moſt materiall parts have béen already confeſſed.</p>
                  <p>I remained with my brother in the countrey from Alhallow-tide untill the beginning of Lent, in the yeare of our Lord 1603. the firſt yeare of the Kings reigne; about which time Maſter Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesby ſent thither, intreating me to come to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where he and other my friends would bée glad to ſée me. I deſired him to excuſe me: for I found my ſelfe not very well diſpoſed; and (which had happened never to me before) returned the meſſenger without my company. Shortly, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived another Letter, in any wiſe to come. At the ſecond ſummons I preſently came up, and found him with Maſter Iohn Wright at Lambeth, where he brake with me, how neceſſary it was not to forſake our Countrey (for he knew then I had a reſolution to goe over) but to deliver her from the ſervitude in which ſhe remained, or at leaſt to aſſiſt her with our uttermoſt endeavours. I anſwered, that I had often hazzarded my life upon far lighter termes, and now would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe any good occaſion, wherein I might doe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Catholique cauſe, but for my ſelfe I knew no meane probable to ſuccéed. Hée ſaid that he had bethought him of a way at one inſtant to deliver us from all our bonds, and without any forraine help to replant againe the Catholique Religion; and withall told me in a word, It was to blow up the Parliament houſe with Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder; for, ſaid he, in that place have they done us all the miſchiefe, and perchance God hath deſigned that place for their puniſhment. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the ſtrangeneſſe of the conceit, and told him, that true it was, this ſtrake at the roote, and would bréed a confuſion fit to beget new alterations: but if it ſhould not take effect, (as moſt of this nature miſcarried) the ſcandall would be ſo great which Catholique Religion might hereby ſuſtaine, as not only our enemies, but our friends alſo would with good reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us. Hée told me, The nature of the diſeaſe required ſo ſharpe a remedy, and asked me if I would give my conſent. I told him, yes, in this or what elſe ſoever, if he reſolved upon it, I would venture my life. But I propoſed many difficulties, as want of an houſe, and of one to carry the Mine, noiſe in the working, and ſuch like. His anſwer was, Let us give an attempt, and where it faileth, paſſe no further. But firſt, quoth he, becauſe we will leave no peaceable and quiet way untryed, you ſhall goe over and informe the Conſtable of the ſtate of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes here in England, intreating him to ſollicite his Majeſty at his comming hither, that the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Lawes may be recalled, and we admitted into the ranke of his other ſubjects; withall, you may being over ſome confident Gentleman, ſuch as you ſhall underſtand beſt able for this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and named unto me Maſter Fawkes. Shortly after I paſſed the Sea, and found the Conſtable at Berghen néere Dunkirke, where by help of Maſter Owen I delivered my meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Whoſe anſwer was, that he had ſtrict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from his Maſter, to doe all good offices for the Catholiques, and for his owne part he thought himſelfe bound in conſcience ſo to doe, and that no good occaſion ſhould be omitted, but ſpake to him nothing of this matter,</p>
                  <p>Returning to Dunkirk with Maſter Owen, we had ſpéech whether he thought the Conſtable would faithfully help us, or no. He ſaid, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeved nothing leſſe, and that they ſought only their owne ends, holding ſmall account of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes. I told him that there were many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in England, who would not forſake their Countrey untill they had tryed their uttermoſt, and rather venture their lives, then forſake her in this miſery. And to adde one more to our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as a fit man both for counſell and execution

I went ſoone after to Oſtend, where Sir William Stanley as then was not, but c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e two daies after. I remained with him thrée or foure daies, in which time I asked him if the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in England ſhould doe any thing to help themſelves, whether hee thought the Archduke would ſecond them? Hee anſwered, no: for an thoſe parts were ſo deſirous of peace with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as they would endure no ſpéech of other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe; neither were it fit, ſaid he, to ſet any project a foot now the peace is upon concluding. I told him there was no ſuch reſolution, and ſo fell to diſcourſe of other matters, untill I came to ſpeake of Maſter Fawkes, whoſe company I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> wiſhed over into England. I asked of his ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in the warres, and told him we ſhould néed ſuch as he if occaſion required; he gave very good commendations of him. And as we were thus diſcourſing, and I ready to depart from Newport, and taking my leave of Sir William, Maſter Fawkes came into our company, newly retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſaluted us, This is the Gentleman, ſaid ſir William, that we wiſhed for, and ſo we embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againe. I told him ſome good friends of his wiſhed his company in England, and that if he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> pleaſed to come to Dunkirke, we would have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conference, whither I was then going: ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my leave of them both, I departed. About two daies after came Maſter Fawkes to Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirke, where I told him that we were upon a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to do ſomewhat with England, if the peace with Spaine helped us not, but had as yet reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon nothing; ſuch or the like talk we paſſed at Graveling, where I lay for a winde, and when it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſerved came both in one paſſage to Gréenwith, néere which place we tooke a pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The firſt word he ſpoke (after he came into our company) was, ſhall we alwaies (Gentlemen) talke, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doe any thing? Maſter Catesby tooke him aſide, and had ſpeech about ſomewhat to be done, ſo as firſt we might all take an oath of ſecrecy, which we reſolved within two or thrée days to do; ſo as there we met behind ſaint Clements, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Calesby, Maſter Percy, Maſter Wright, Maſter Guy Fawkes, and my ſelfe; and having <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> upon a Primer given each other the oath of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in a Chamber where no other body was, wee went after into the next roome, and heard maſſe, and received the bleſſed ſacrament upon the ſame.

                  <p>But while we were in the middle of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, we heard that the Parliament ſhould be anew adjourned untill after Michaelmas, upon which tidings we broke off both diſcourſe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> untill after Chriſtmas.

                  <p>After this Maſter Fawkes laid into the cellar (which he had newly taken) a thouſand of billets, and five hundred of fagots, and with that covered the pouder, becauſe we might have the houſe frée, to ſuffer any one to enter that would. Maſter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Catesby wiſhed us to conſider, whether it were not now neceſſary to ſend Maſter Fawkes over, both to abſent himſelfe for a time, as alſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint Sir William Stanley, and Maſter Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with this matter. Wee agréed that he ſhould (provided that he gave it them with the ſame oth that we had taken it before) <hi>viz.</hi> to kéep it ſecret from all the world. The reaſon why we deſired ſir William Stanley ſhould be acquainted herwith, was, to have him with us ſo ſoone as we could; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> And for Maſter Owen, he might hold good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency after with forraine Princes. So Maſter Fawks departed about Eaſter for Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and returned the later end of Auguſt. He told me that when he arrived at Bruſſels, Sir Willam Stanley was not returned from Spain, ſo as he uttered the matter onely to Owen, who ſéemed well pleaſed with the buſineſſe, but. told him that ſurely Sir William would not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with any plot, as having buſineſſe now a foot in the Court of England: but he himſelfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> would be alwayes ready to tell it him, and ſend him away ſo ſoone as it were done.</p>
                  <p>About this time did Maſter Percy and maſter Catesby méet at the Bathe, where they agréed, that the company being yet but few, M. Catesby ſhould have the others authority to call in whom he thought beſt; by which authority hee called in after, Sir Everard Digby, though at what time I know not, and laſt of all Maſter Francis Treſham. The firſt promiſed, as I heard maſter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> Catesby ſay, fiftéene hundred pounds; the ſecond two thouſand pounds; Maſter Percy himſelfe promiſed all that he could get of the Earle of Northumberlands rents, which was about foure thouſand pounds, and to provide many galloping horſes to the number of ten.</p>
                  <p>Meane while Maſter Fawkes and myſelfe alone bought ſome new pouder, as ſuſpecting the firſt to be danke, and conveyed it into the cellar, and ſet it in order as we reſolved it ſhould ſtand.</p>
                  <p>Then was the parliament anew prorogued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till fifth of November, ſo as we all went down untill ſome ten daies before, when Maſter Cates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by came up with Maſter Fawkes to an houſe by Enfield Chace called White Webs, whither I came to them, and Maſter Catesby wiſhed me to enquire whither the young Prince came to the Parliament: I told him that I heard that his grace would not be there. Then muſt we have our horſes, ſaid Maſter Catesby, beyond the water, and proviſion of more company to ſurpriſe the Prince, and leave the Duke alone.</p>
                  <p>Two dayes after being Sunday at night, in came one to my Chamber, and told me that a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had béen given to my Lord Mountegle to this effect, That he wiſhed his Lordſhips abſence from the Parliament, becauſe a blow would there be given; which letter he preſently carried to my Lord of Salisbury.</p>
                  <p>On the morrow I went ot White-Webs, and told it Maſter Catesby, aſſuring him withall that the matter was diſcloſed, and wiſhing him in any caſe to forſake his countrey. He told me he would ſée further as yet, and reſolved to ſend M. Fawkes to try the uttermoſt, proteſting that if it were his caſe, he would try the ſame adventure.</p>
                  <p>On Wedneſday Maſter Fawkes went and returned at night, of which we were very glad.</p>
                  <p>On Thurſday I came to London, &amp; on Fryday M. Catesby, M. Treſham and I met at Barnet, where we queſtioned how this letter ſhould be ſent to my Lord Mountegle, but could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceive; for M. Treſham forſware it, whom we ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p>On Saturday night I met Maſter Treſham againe in Lincolnes Inne walkes. Where he told ſuch ſpéeches, that my Lord of Salisbury ſhould uſe to the King, as I gave it loſt the ſecond time, and repeated the ſame to Maſter Catesby, who hereupon was reſolved to be gone, but ſtayed to have Maſter Percy come up, whoſe conſent herein we wanted. On Sunday Maſter Percy being dealt with to that end would néeds abide the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt triall.</p>
                  <p>This ſuſpition of all hands put us into ſuch confuſion, as Maſter Catesby reſolved to goe downe into the countrey the Munday that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Percy went to Syon, and Maſter Percy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to follow the ſame night, or early the next morning. About five of the clocke being Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, came the younger Wright to my chamber, and told me that a Nobleman called the Lord Montegle, ſaying, Ariſe, and come along to Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex houſe, for I am going to call up my Lord of Northumberland; ſaying withall, The matter is diſcovered. Goe backe Maſter Wright (quoth I) and learne what you can about Eſſex gate. Shortly, he returned, and ſaid, Surely all is loſt: for Lepton is got on horſebacke at Eſſex doore: and as hee parted, he asked if their Lordſhips would have any more with him; and being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered no, is rode as faſt up Fléetſtreéet as hee can ride. Goe you then (quoth I) to Maſter Percy, for ſure it is for him they ſéeke, and bid him be gone, I will ſtay and ſée the uttermoſt. Then I went to the Court gates, and found them ſtraightly garded, ſo as no body could enter. From thence I went middle of Kings ſtreet found the gard ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that would not let me paſſe. And as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned I heard one ſay, There is a Treaſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, in which the King and the Lords ſhould have béen blowne up. So then I was fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that all was knowne, and went to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble where my gelding ſtood, and rode into the Countrey. Maſter Catesby had appointed our

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> houſe, where the next day (being Friday) as I was early abroad to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, my man came unto me, and ſaid, That an heavy miſchance had ſevered all the company; for that Maſter Catesby, Maſter Rookewood, &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Grant were burned with Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouder, upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> which ſight the reſt diſperſed. Maſter Littleton wiſhed me to fly, and ſo would he. I told him I would firſt ſée the body of my friend, and bury him, whatſoever befelme. When I came I found Maſter Catesby reaſonable well, Maſter Percy, both the Wrights, Maſter Rookewood, and Maſter Grant. I asked them what they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to doe: they anſweed, We mean here to die. I ſaid againe, I would take ſuch part as they did. About e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>even of the clocke came the company to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> beſet the houſe, and as I walked into the Court, I was ſhot into the ſhoulder, which loſt me the uſe of mine arme: the next ſhot was the elder Wright ſtricken dead, after him the younger Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Wright, and fourthly Ambroſe Rookewood ſhot. Then ſaid Maſter Catesby to me (ſtanding before the doore they were to enter) ſtand by mee Tom, and we will dye together. Sir, quoth I, I have loſt the uſe of my right arme, and I ſeare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> will cauſe me to be taken. So as we ſtood cloſe together. Maſter Catesby, Maſter Percy, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and myſelfe, they two were ſhot (as farre as I could gueſſe, with one bullet) and then the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny entred upon me, hurt me in the belly with a pike, and gave me other wounds, untill one came behind, and caught hold of both mine armes.</p>

                  <p>And ſo after that this Catholique troup had wandered a while through Warwicke ſhire to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Worceſter ſhire; and from thence to the edge and borders of Stafford ſhire, this gallantly armed band had not the honor at the laſt to bee beaten with the Kings Lievtenant or extraordinary Commiſſioners ſent down for the purpoſe, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Their flight.</note> by the ordinary Sheriffe of Worceſter ſhire were they all beaten, killed, taken, and diſperſed.

                  <p>Although divers of the Kings Proclamations were poſted downe after theſe Traitors with all the ſpeed poſſible, declaring the odiouſneſſe of that bloudy attempt, the neceſſity to have had Percy preſerved alive, if it had bin poſſible, and the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly together of that damned crew, now no more ſecret conſpirators, but open and avowed rebels; yet the farre diſtance of the way (which was above <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> an hundred miles) together with the extreame déepneſſe thereof, joyned alſo with the ſhortneſſe of the day, was the cauſe that the hearty and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving affections of the Kings good ſubjects in thoſe parts prevented the ſpéed of his Proclamations.

And to this purpoſe alſo had that Nimrod Digby provided his hunting match againſt the ſame time, that numbers of people being flocked together upon the pretence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> thereof, they might the eaſilier have brought to paſſe the ſudden ſurpriſe of her perſon.</p>
                  <p>Now the violent taking away of thoſe horſes long before day, did ſéeme to be ſo great a riot in the eies of the common people, that knew of no greater myſtery: And the bold attempting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of did ingender ſuch a ſuſpition of ſome follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rebellion in the hearts of the wiſer ſort, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> both great and ſmall began to ſtirre and arme themſelves, upon this unlooked for accident.

But as upon the one part, the zealous duty to their God and their Soveraigne was ſo déeply imprinted in the hearts of all the meaneſt and poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſort of the people (although then knowing of no further myſtery then ſuch publique miſbehavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours as their owne eyes taught them) as not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their faire ſhewes, and pretence of their Catholique cauſe, no creature, man or woman through all the countrey, would once ſo much as give them willingly a cup of drinke, or any ſort of comfort or ſupport, but with execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deteſted them: So on the other part, the Sheriffes of the ſhires, wherethrough they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, convening their people with all ſpéed poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, hunted as hotly after them, as the evilneſſe of the way, and the unprovidedneſſe of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon that ſudden could permit them. And ſo at laſt after Sir Richard Verney, Sheriffe of Warwickeſhire, had carefully and ſtraightly bin in chaſe of them to the confines of his County, part of the meaner ſort being alſo apprehended by him; Sir Richard Walſh Sheriffe of Worceſter ſhire did likewiſe dutifully and hotly purſue them through his ſhire; And having gotten ſure tryall of their taking harbour at the houſe above named, he did ſend trumpeters and meſſengers to them, commanding them in the Kings name to render unto him his Majeſties Miniſter; and knowing no more at that time of their guilt then was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely viſible, did promiſe upon their dutifull and obedient rendring unto him, to intercede at the Kings hand for the ſparing of their lives: Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived only from them this ſcornfull anſwer (they being better witneſſes to themſelves, of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evill conſciences.)

               <p>After many daies the Biſhop with ſundry other Lords, calling him before them, aſked him if the heretiques had not perſwaded him to uſe ſuch words as he had ſpoken: alſo whether he had not a reſolution to kill the Quéene, or her ſon the King, or the Biſhop of Vilne?

               <p>THrée Engliſh men méeting together entered into a conference concerning the ſtate of the Church at that time, complaining that the zeale of Gods glory was wonderfully cooled among men, yea and that even thoſe of the religion were growne but too worldly wiſe; that ſatan by little was ſowing the ſéeds of Atheiſme every where, by rocking men aſléep in the cradle of ſecurity: whereupon having in humble manner commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> themſelves into the hands of God, they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to take their voyage to Rome, and there to encounter with the adverſary of Chriſt.

The people in a rage fell upon the Engliſhman; who, being altogether bruiſed with their fiſts and féet, ſaid, you hangman, finde out as many forments as you can, the hand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> of the Almighty will ſhew it ſelf the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.

               <p>It ſo fell out, that the Iaylour ſmelling the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice which theſe reverend Fathers were devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing againſt the poore priſoner, adventured to give him notice of it, to the end he making his peace with God might fit himſelfe for death. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſouldier of Ieſus Chriſt plotted a way under hand, by a ſpirituall wile, to catch the wiſe in their craftineſſe: faining therefore a repentance, he called for his judges, telling them he was now minded to revoke his errors, after they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſentence againſt him, and would in the hearing of all recant what he had in publike main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained againſt the truth.</p>
               <p>His Iudges, beléeving he had ſpoken in good earneſt, promiſed him his life upon thoſe tearmes. Now that they might the rather ſatisfie their pride, they made known to every one the time and place appointed for his abjuration. All the city aſſembled together to take knowledge of this ſo unexpected a novelty. Montalchin was brought and placed on a ſcaffold for that purpoſe. He ſtood there in his ſhirt, holding in his hands two torches lighted: then ſilence being obtained, he began to ſpeake to the people as followeth.</p>
               <p>Deare brethren and Children, I have a long time taught you ſuch a doctrine as hath troubled you. I am now brought hither to open my minde unto you. Montalchin is a ſinfull man and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may erre. But lend me your attention a while, and I will let you ſée the difference betwéen both opinions: Thrée words <hi>(ſeul, ſeule, ſeulement)</hi> will ſerve to diſtinguiſh betwéene falſhood and truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1 I have taught you that Chriſt is our only ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, our only prieſt, who only was once offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us. But the Doctors teach the contrary, to wit, that the true body of Chriſt without bread is offered up for the living and for the dead, that the prieſts ought daily to offer up the naturall body of Chriſt really in the Maſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 I have taught that in taking the viſible ſignes in the Sacrament, we doe therein by faith only take the ſpirituall and heavenly bread of our ſoules.</p>
               <p>The Doctors ſay, that Chriſts body is taken fleſh and blood into the mouth and belly of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant.</p>
               <p n="3">3 I have preached that Ieſus Chriſt is our, only mediator, and that by him alone we have acceſſe unto the Father.</p>
               <p>But the Doctors goe further, and will have us to come to the Virgin Mary, making her and all the Saints departed our Mediators and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
               <p n="4">4 I have declared that we are juſtified only by faith in Ieſus Chriſt, and that the frée mercy of God is the foundation of our ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The Doctors would have us to help out faith and grace by good workes <hi>as meritorious cauſes of ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 You have heard me preach that Chriſt only gives grace; and that he alone pardons this.</p>
               <p>They affirm that the Church hath a Coffer or Cheſt, of which the Pope kéeps the keyes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into are put the merits of ſaints, which he largely
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65665:57"/> diſtributed abroad to ſuch as will buy his pardons <note place="margin">Anno 1611.</note> with money.</p>
               <p n="6">6 I have told you that the Canonicall bookes of the old and new Teſtament are the onely ground of our faith and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The Doctors adde thereto their unwritten ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>
               <p n="7">7 I have taught you that after this life ended there are only two places prepared for them to goe unto who die and depart out of this world; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> One, the place of joy and comfort, the other of torment.</p>
               <p>The Doctors ſay, there are foure, <hi>viz.</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, Hell, Limbus, and Purgatory.</p>
               <p n="8">8 I have preached that the Pope is not a god on earth, but only a Biſhop, and that only of one place, if he therein behave himſelfe as a good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ought to doe.</p>
               <p>The Doctors make him Lord of the world, and the head of the viſible Church. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> 
               </p>
               <p n="9">9 Now O Chriſtian brethren, Iudge you of that which I have ſaid, and ſée if you can diſcerne Truth from Error; Truth leads you to life, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and bleſſedneſſe; Error and lies to death and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Be now either ſervants of Truth, or the ſlaves of Error. For my part I will cleave to the truth of the Goſpell, and doe condemne all errors and lies: let Montalchin die, and live thou, O Lord Ieſus.</p>
               <p>Then threw he downe his two burning torches, one this way, and another that way, offering his hands to be tyed and bound, which cauſed a great tumult among the people. Montalchin was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back again to priſon.</p>
               <p>Now Reader, it will not be hard for thée to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what entertainment he found there: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the Popes <note n="*" place="margin">Which was to put the martyrs to death, privily, as was noted in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this hiſtory.</note> Decrée was executed to the full upon this worthy Confeſſor, who in the face of the world did ſo nobly triumph over Satan and Antichriſt his Lieutenant.</p>

               <p>Within a ſhort time after was murdered a ſervant of the Governour of that place, where the rage and fury of thoſe murderers grew unto that height, that they did not only contemne the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65665:57"/> Proclamations publiſhed by the Governor, but in <note place="margin">Anno 1620.</note> ſcorn and deſpite thereof they paſſed up and downe before the Palace, threatening to kill the ſaid go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and other principall perſons of the Church of France.</p>
               <p>Now for that the ordinary Magiſtrate of that place was not ſtrong enough to repreſſe the outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and inſolencies of thoſe villaines, from whom none could bee ſecure either in their houſes or abroad, by reaſon of the frequent attempts which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> they made upon the Proteſtants, the rather for that they bordered néere upon a forraine jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to which they had recourſe when they had committed any miſchiefe, the Governour was conſtrained to make his addreſſe for juſtice to the ſoveraigne Dabe of the countrey, who about the midſt of February, anno 1620, granted a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherein were named theſe commiſſioners, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lords Ioachinas Montalta, at this time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Vicar of the Valtoline. Iohn Baptiſta of Salichi, a Doctor of Law, Ia. Rumel a captain, Salomon Candeamma Buoli, Landlaine of Tavos, in the ten juriſdictions, Dieteganus Fertmannus, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Lordſhip of Meienfield, and Iohn An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea Miniardino for the Chancellorſhip, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By theſe perſons, beſides the proceſſes framed already by the Lords, Iohn of Cappaul, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Tyrano, and Andreo Enderlino of Tegly, there were againe divers proceſſes framed anew, and upon the impriſonment and revealing of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> perſons it was diſcovered and confeſſed, there was a reſolution made in the ſame place of Boalty to put to the ſword not only the Preacher if he had preached, but alſo all the people, as many as profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Goſpell, as they could light upon, yea even the magiſtrate himſelfe; beſides there were divers perſons diſcovered, and thoſe of principall ranke, who were the authors of thoſe wicked and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous practiſes, and had promiſed all poſſible ayde and aſſiſtance unto them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, the importance of the buſineſſe being of great conſequence, it was thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that thoſe Lords, Commiſſioners, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Tavoz, and report to the Court of juſtice, which there reſided, all the buſineſſe which reſulted of theſe proceſſes; which they accordingly did about the midſt of April laſt paſt. Moreover, they were intreated by divers noble perſons of the proteſtant Church of the Valtoline, that they would with all poſſible ſpéed provide a garriſon of Griſons for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> defence of the vally, in regard that by the foreſaid diſcovery they had great reaſon to feare a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rebellion, in caſe they ſhould procéed to chaſtiſe the authors of thoſe tumults and diſorders, and that ſuch a buſineſſe could not be, without intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the Spaniard, and that ſo much the more likely, that ſome certaine yeares agoe ſuch another practiſe had bin diſcovered and attempted to be put in practiſe, as came to paſſe 1584. and ſince of late. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> 
               </p>
               <p>All theſe buſineſſes were conſidered, but it was not poſſible to put ſame in effect for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, had it not béen that they received intelligence that a number of Spaniards approached néere to the thrée pleves, which were places adjoyning to the Valtoline, by which occaſion the Magiſtrate and governors of the Valtoline were conſtrained to put a guard néere the trenches of Trahona, and Morben, about the Calends of Iuly 1620, thinking to ſecure the valley from the forraine enemy: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> that guard conſiſted of the Countrey-men, and dwellers in the Valtoline: &amp; this courſe wrought no other effect but that the Proteſtants by this meanes were incloſed in of all ſides, that they could not flée away on that ſide, by the way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready concluded, but anticipated within eight daies which was the Sabboth day.

                  <p>Neither did thoſe furious perſecutors reſt here, but beſides they cut off Baſſoes head, and carried it into the Church, and fixed it upon a pole in the pulpit where before time he was wont to preach, ſaving with all diſgrace and ſcorne, Come downe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> Baſſo, thou haſt preached long enough already.</p>
                  <p>In like manner at the ſame time the Palace of the Chequer of Tyrane was beſieged by thoſe helhounds; wherein dwelt Senior Iohn de Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paul being at that time governor. To which place Michael Lazarone, a man of good account and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of that office, had retired himſelfe early in the morning to ſave his life. But becauſe he was extreamely hated of the Papiſts, by reaſon of his ſingular piety, religion, and ſincerity, hee was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> eſpecially purſued by them; inſomuch as thoſe rebels followed him even to the palace, threatning to ſet fire on the ſame, if he were not delivered into their hands. Lazarone ſéeing that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Palace was well furniſhed with great ordnance, faulcons, muskets, munition, and other neceſſary proviſions, he was like to fall into the hands of his enemies, for that the ſaid Governor was reſolved in his judgement to overcome thoſe miſcreants rather by faire and courteous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> than by force, was inforced that evening to fly out of the houſe, and to hide himſelfe about the banks of the river Adda, wherein he covered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and lay cloſe thrée whole houres all naked, poore Gentleman, to ſave himſelfe. But his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and principally Doctor Vincentio followed him hotly, accompanied with many ſhot, and at the laſt they found him, and drew him out of the water. And albe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>it he did with teares in his eyes beſéech them that they would give him his life, in compaſſion of his deare ſmall children, yet could not he obtaine that favor at their hands, but they anſwered him, That this was no time for pitty, and favour: but if he would ſweare by the Popes Bull, and abjure his Faith, in that caſe they would ſhew him favor, and grant him his life. But he, with a great and couragious reſolution, anſwered, God forbid and defend that I for love of this temporall life ſhould deny my Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who with his precious bloud upon the wood of the Croſſe did at ſo deare a rate redéeme me, and after that I have ſo long time through his grace fréely and publikely confeſſed him, ſhould now hazard the loſſe of eternall life, to which I was elected before the foundation of the World; I ſay God forbid. Upon this ſpéech he was in moſt barbarous and ſavage manner murthered by them.</p>
                  <p>The very ſame evening was the gate of the palace burnt to the ground by thoſe rebels, who the next morning entred into the ſame, raging with fury, and tooke the Governour priſoner with his young ſonne; ſpoyling and ranſacking wives, and maidens, and carrying away all they could lay hands on. The Governour of the Palace was carried away priſoner to the houſe of the foreſaid Dort Franceſco, and at laſt, after he had long time béen tugged to and fro, hee was miſerably ſlaine with a ſhot.</p>

                  <p>To be ſhort, theſe villaines had no regard of any perſon, neither young, nor old, nor weake, nor ſtrong, but all of all ſorts were either ſhot unto death, or cut in pieces, or in one manner or other deſtroyed; and the number of thoſe perſons in eſtimation, who in Tyrane received the crown of martyrdome for the profeſſion of the Goſpell, was about ſixty.</p>
                  <p>Of thoſe who by the grace of God, although with great danger, eſcaped through the horrid and vaſte Alpes into Retia and other parts, were only thrée perſons, that is, Doctor Iacobo Albertino, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobo Nevio de Coyra, and Egidio Venoſta, who left behind them wealth, wives, children, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever goods they had.</p>

                  <p>THeſe wicked and ſavage wretches, having in this manner executed and finiſhed this their impious and execrable enterpriſe at Tyrane and Tell, aſſembled themſelves in the middeſt of the Valley of Sondres, where the principall and chiefe Iuſtice of the Country made his reſidence, having before placed ſecure guards upon every
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65665:59"/> paſſage of the countrey about. They came prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by the conduct of Giovani Guizziardi, Proſpero Swadino, and Guilio Pozalis, being all thrée of Ponte, with an entire company of ſouldiers from Ponte, Chiur, and ſome few from Porti, who the very ſame Sunday marched to the gate of Alboſagia: in which place they found Lorenco Paribello a doctor, Giovan, Iacomo, and Floratio his ſons, with another company of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers attending the comming of the aboveſaid Iohn <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Guizziardi with his company.</p>

                  <p>Some of them endeavouring to flée towards the valley of Malenco, which lies againſt Poſchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aro, Agnedma, and Pregalia, were murthered by certaine villaines of Ponchiero, a place about Sondres: and amongſt other Gentle women were wounded and run through in many parts Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Marliamio, Giovanni Andrea Chiſſa, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> others, particularly Doctor Bartholomed Paravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cino, Doctor of the Law in Berbenno, called the Fatt, who was cruelly murthered, being of age 53 yeares.</p>
                  <p>The day after was ſlaine in the morning Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholo Marlianco, ſonne of Felloſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hee was ſhot by his couſin germane Emilio Luvizaro méeting him in the ſtréet, the ſaid Marlianco going in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of Lucio Orſchletta of Zornezo Agnadina the lower, to viſit the court of guard in the quarre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of Sondres, age 46.</p>
                  <p>At this time it was delivered for certaine, that the day before was murthered Ceſar the ſonne of Proſpero Paravicino, and of Hortenſia Marte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninga, Counteſſe of Barco, a Gentleman of moſt rare abilities, travelling about his buſineſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Treſiar, age 50. Beſides Proſpero his ſon was ſlaine, of age 27. alſo Battiſta Girrardo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> with his ſonne George, and many others: by which meanes, theſe proteſtants were ſo ſcattered and left deſtitute of any head for their conduct, that they could not poſſibly unite themſelves to make defence againſt their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Onely the Chancellor Giovan Andrea Migar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dino, calling to remembrance the matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the aboveſaid proceſſes, the ſame ſabbath day the ninth of Iuly, with his brother Gregory, and others of the Church of Sondres, withdrew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> themſelves to the number of eightéene together, with certaine Ladies and their young children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their owne houſe, which is adjoyning to the Palace, and there they fortified themſelves with reſolution to defend themſelves even to the death, ſéeing that in the ſtréet wherein they dwelt none durſt come out of the doores, nor enter into the Church which ſtood over againſt them. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the enemy reſolved to ſet upon the houſe with a thouſand armed men, threatening alſo the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to kill him, in caſe any of them ſhould take any harm by thoſe who were retired into the houſe. Whereupon the Magiſtrate commanded them in the houſe to depart; who being well armed tooke their way on the ſudden by Sondres towards the bridge, where for a time they fortified themſelves, then returning again, they drew unto them certain others, and marched towards the Church of the Mountaine of Sondres. In which place being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together with the Paſtor, they made their prayers to God, and afterwards to the number of thréeſcore and thirtéene perſons in all they paſſed the valley of Malenco, which was beſet by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on two ſides: but thoſe that kept thoſe places were by the providence of God ſo aſtoniſhed, that they fled away, and the proteſtants, although they were purſued to the tops of the hils, did miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly eſcape with ſafety.</p>
                  <p>The enemy, that is to ſay, the proper Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the valley, with their ringleaders Iames Robuſtello, Azzo Beſta, Iohn Guizziardi, Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo Paribello, and others entred into the Palace, they deprived the Magiſtrate of his office, that is to ſay, Giovanni, Andrea Traerſio of Scants, of the upper Agnadua, Captaine and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Valtoline, who with his family had retired himſelfe into the houſe of Paul Clamar untill Wednesday the eleventh of Iuly; on which day, under proteſtation to ſecure them, they were conducted to Malenco, where in the Village of Chiſſa, againſt their faith given, they were mads priſoners, and detained for eight daies following. They who by the commandement of the ſaid cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine found themſelves to bee made priſoners were delivered, putting in their roome certaine of the Religion. They immediately changed the Calender, and gave for a prey the goods of the Proteſtants: by which occaſion great multitudes of perſons aſſembled from all the parts of the Valtoline to rob and ſpoile; and by reaſon of the ſwéetneſſe which they found in pillaging the goods they met with in divers noble houſes excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well furniſhed, grew an intolerable heate and outrage to ſpoile, inſomuch as brother robbed brother, and the néereſt of kindred purſued and robbed one another, and followed one another to the death. The peaſants, hoping by meanes hereof to be exempted from paying their yearely rents, ranne with all fury and madnes about the woods, buſhes, and mountaines, ſearching after the poore Proteſtants, who were ſcattered by feare, whom they murthered as they found them with extreme cruelty.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt theſe were theſe Gentlemen of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt worth and reſolution, Doctor Bartolomeo Paravicino of Sondres, from whom they tooke about two thouſand crownes; Doctor Nicolas his brother, whoſe brother Doctor Lelio had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore béen ſlaine in the Church of Tell; Petronio Paravicino, Doctor, and Giovan Battiſta Malle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio of Antwerpe in the Low-Countries, a man endued with excellent rare qualities of mind and body; for he was both a good Philoſopher and a learned Divine, and very fit to inſtruct youth he was ſurpriſed in the houſe of Morone, and when they had ſtoned him to death, they cut off his head, ripped his belly, and tooke out his entrailes. His Children, Giovan, Andrea, and Catharine were carried to Millane.</p>
                  <p>Annaidi Lita, wife of Anthony Grotti of Chio in the territory of Vincentine, of an honorable and antient houſe, was come out of Italy but ſome few yeares before for the liberty of her conſcience. This Anna was firſt by them exhorted with faire words to change her Religion; but ſhe conſtantly

When he was bound in chains, being carried from Chio, he ſaid, You may indéed bind my perſon, but the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> word of God ſhall never the more be bound in the hearts of the elect, that it doe not ſhew manifeſtly it ſelfe, and bring forth fruit, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>According to this moſt Chriſtian example Iohn Stéeven Moron and Rodulfo Rivello, being both of them of the Valley of Sondres, did not onely in their proper perſons ſeal with their bloud the truth of the Goſpell, but moreover exhorted their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Iohn Andrea, and Iohn Antonio, the one of them being fiftéene yeares of age, the other ten, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> that they ſhould doe the like, following the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable example of the ſeven brethren in the Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bées, and of their mother, who choſe rather to dye, than to obey the King, and to tranſgreſſe the Law of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And yet by reaſon of the money and jewels found in the houſes and cheſts of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, the eagerneſſe and fury of each of thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants increaſed daily more and more; inſomuch as that there were neither noble nor ignoble, nor Lady, no neither man, woman, young nor old, of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> what condition ſoever, who were not ranſacked and ſpoiled, ſome twiſe, and others oft times thriſe over. Some honourable matrons had their rings pulled off their fingers, inſomuch as they would cut off their hands and fingers, if they would not preſently draw them off. Some women were by force dragged up to the tops of high and craggy mountaines, and threatened to be throwne downe headlong with their children, unleſſe they would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> goe to maſſe. And although Lucretia the wife of Antonio Lavizaro, and Katherina wife of Giulio Merlianico, being moved and terrified with the horror of death, had conſented to change their Religion, yet were they murthered for all that without any pitty at all.</p>
                  <p>The ſame befell to D. Io. Battiſta Salici of Soglio in the Pregaglia; for although that his life was promiſed him, nevertheleſſe he was brought into the market place of the ſaid Campello pinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a cord, and miſerably ſlain with two muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers, being of the age of 72. after he had bin rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of his gold and ſilver, whereof great ſtore was found in his houſe, according to the common and too much practiſed rule of the Roman Catholikes, <hi>Haereticis non eſt ſervanda <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Dominico Berto, an aged man of 67 yeres, was ſet upon an Aſſe, his face turned to the taile, which he held in his hand in ſtead of a bridle, and in his other hand a booke, whom in this manner they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through Sondres, ſaying, <hi>Aleſſio, Aleſſio,</hi> &amp;c. they cut off his cares, his noſe, his chéekes, boring holes in divers parts of his body, with a ſtrange and unheard of barbarouſneſſe, untill they had quite killed him; but he for the love of Chriſt his Savior with great and incredible courage &amp; cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe endured all thoſe varieties of torments and martyrdome. And by this it may be gathered what they would have don with Seignior Aleſſio, a faithfull Paſtor of the Church of Sondres, if he had falne into the hands of theſe raging beaſts. But he by the great mercy of God was preſerved with his wife and children, in the company of ſeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Georgio Ienatro Miniſter of Berbenno, and Charles Salice ſon of Cavaliere Hercole of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py memory, and others, not without great travell, danger and difficulties, among the craggy and dangerous mountains, whereon they travelled, it ſo pleaſing the gracious God by the vertue of his ſpirit graciouſly to aſſiſt him, although he was in the midſt of his perſecutors.</p>
                  <p>Anthony de Prati of the hils was with many words exhorted to abjure his Religion; but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly perſevered, and with a generous courage replyed in theſe words, <hi>My ſoule ſhall be taken up into Abrahams boſome, and after my death my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall ſee the Angell of God hard by mee, &amp;c.</hi> and accordingly an Angell appeared over his body in a white garment, being beheld of the by-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who of their owne accord have publikely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Theophilo Moſſino received into his body a ſhot with a musket: but before he was dead a gag was put in his mouth, which being filled with gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouder, fire was given to it, and in that manner he paſſed miſerably out of this life; Giovanni his ſon was ſlain with ſeven wounds.</p>
                  <p>Seignior Salvetto, being delivered out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was inſtantly exhorted to embrace the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Romane Religion. But notwithſtanding he conſtantly perſiſted, although he was both young in yeares, and a lover of worldly vanities: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received a ſhot of a musket was carried by a ladder out of the Palace to the ground, from whence he raiſed himſelfe, and beſought them to finiſh the worke they had to doe about his body, that he might render his ſoule to his Creator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 28 yeares of age.</p>

                  <p>IN what manner alſo buſineſſes paſſed in the noble Countrey of Berbenno it doth likewiſe plainly appeare; for in that place alſo the rebels played their part of killing and ſpoyling the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Goſpell. For after they had executed their cruelties and outrages, as hath bin delivered before in Tyrane, Bruſe, Tell, Sondres, in the mountaine of Sondres, Malenco and other places, they alſo received ſpeciall commandement, as may appeare by a letter written to them by Iohn Guizziardi, of the twelfth of Iuly of the preſent yeare, that they ſhould with all their power and courage, murther, ſtrangle, maſſacre, and in ſumme ſhould uſe all diligence, without favour or mercy, to deſtroy all Lutheranes whereſoever: by vertue of which commiſſion they have not for their parts omitted any manner of outrage and villany a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtants. And firſt there were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently murthered certaine perſons of good ranke and quality, and that with great cruelty, againſt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65665:60"/> faith and promiſe given them. The which was with ſo much the more rage and fury put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for that thoſe Catholique Romans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who upon the firſt propoſition refuſing to give their conſents on the ſudden to thoſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, were without reſpect or favour on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den murdered themſelves, as happened to Barto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeo Porret to, and other Romane Catholikes.</p>
                  <p>The Proteſtants that were maſſacred were theſe that follow, Theophilus de Piſcatory of Og<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano in Romagna, who had dwelt in Berbenno <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> twenty yeares paſt, was ſlaine in a place above Berbenno called Luſcione, the tenth of Iuly, of the age of ſixty five yeares.</p>
                  <p>Anna di Caſſavia of Pregaglia, wife of the aboveſaid Theophilus, was before murdered at a houſe called the Chanons of Berbenno the day aboveſaid, aged fifty yeares.</p>
                  <p>Concordia Crotta of Tyrane, the wife of Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van Gugelman of the territory of Zuriz, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> had dwelt in Berbenno as many yeares, was maſſacred in the place and on the day abovena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, being of the age of forty thrée.</p>
                  <p>Aurelio the ſon of Nicolas Paravicino, going from Berbenno to Sondres, was ſlaine in the plaine of Caſtione, the eightéenth of Iuly, aged fifty ſeven.</p>
                  <p>Bartolomeo the ſon of David Paravicino was wounded to death in the head with the ſhot of a Muſket, who, quite againſt the hope and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chirurgions, lived five daies after, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> then dyed, being eightéen yeares of age.</p>
                  <p>Dttavio Paravicino of Capelli, an honourable Gentleman, was together with two others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwritten, Iohn Battiſta and Horatio Paravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cino detained as priſoners in the Chanons of Berbenno, from the eleventh unto the ſixe and twentieth day of Iuly, on which day they were requeſted and accompanied to Sondres by the commandement of Robuſtello, who pretended <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> with all kindneſſe and courteſie to entertaine them; cauſing them to drinke, and to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied even unto Saſſella: But there, by order of the ſaid Robuſtello, they were murdred; who replyed, being demanded why he did ſo, That they muſt never kéepe faith with heretiques. This Ottavio was thirty eight yeares of age.</p>
                  <p>Iohn Battiſta Paravicino of Capelli a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman alſo of great honour, who was kept priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as aforeſaid, and conducted to Sondres, in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> returne unto Saſſella, there with Ottavio was ſlaine, béeing of the age of foure and thirty yeares.</p>
                  <p>Horatio, brother of the ſaid Iohn Battiſta, was wholly and in all things his faithfull companion, and in like manner rendred his life the day above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, being thirty two yeares of age.</p>
                  <p>Anna de Beveri of Gineura, wife of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Ottavio, a Gentlewoman of an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtimation, being deſirous for the ſafety of her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> life to follow a company of Griſon ſouldiers, amongſt whom was a couſin of hers, and other kinſman of hers, not being able to travell by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſharpneſſe and ſteepneſſe of the way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a gentlewoman grave and tender, was ſhot in the backe with a Muſket, and left for dead the third of Auguſt, being forty yeares of age.</p>
                  <p>Theoſina Paravicina of Capelli, mother of the aboveſaid Iohn Battiſta, and Horatio, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of great worth, was ſlaine in her owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> houſe, being of the age of fifty five yeares.</p>
                  <p>Adamo Scarumveio of Tyrane was at the time of the barbarous maſſacre of Tyrane in the garriſon of Morbenno, from whence notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he eſcaped and came to Clavenno, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards meaning to returne with the Land of Griſons to the Valtoline, and to accompany the ſaid Theoſina to Sondres, was murdered, being twenty yeares of age.

                     <hi>THeſe</hi> wretched murderers were not contented in the places abovenamed, which were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Lords Griſons at Tyrane, Tell, Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres, Monte di Sondrio, Berbenno and Malenco, to have maſſacred ſo many perſons who feared God, honorable, noble, learned, wiſe, and ſober, of authority and reverence, young and old, men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> yea even their next alliance, ſtraiteſt friends and kinsfolks, by ſhooting them, by throwing them headlong from mountaines, by ſtoning them, by hewing them in péeces, by caſting them in rivers, by burning, by mangling them, and by all cruell meanes making them away: but they alſo execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the like cruelty in Retia it ſelfe, the countrey of their naturall Lords and Commanders.</p>
                  <p>For example, on Sunday the ninth of Iuly, a young man called Iohn the ſon of Dominico of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Ada a Romane Catholike, early in the morning travelled to the bridge of the caſtle of Bruſe, being the way to Tyrane, to buy corn for his houſe; there he met Ambroſio the ſon of Baruffino his hoſt in Tyrane, with a company of people, who were at the time endeavouring to breake down the bridge, not ſuffering any paſſage to the ſaid Iohn, but commanded him to returne back again. At which the man wondering, and aſking the reaſon, they anſwered, That they meant not only to ſtop the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> paſſage of the Lutheraues of Bruſe, but alſo at once utterly to root them out. This young man ſuddenly returned to Bruſe, and reported unto Martine Martino, the ſon of Dominico, this which he had ſéen and heard. Vdillo being then his ſervant, who was a Proteſtant, runs with great ſpéed to give warning to the Proteſtants, not thinking that they were in the Church; but although they were diligently attending the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he was bold to publiſh the notice thereof to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> them all. The people were much aſtoniſhed at the newes, and were about to depart out of the church: but they were earneſtly deſired by the Paſtor to ſtay ſtill, proteſting, that he would not forſake them, but would live and die with them. So they continued ſtill, untill the Sermon and Prayers were ended. Then they armed themſelves, and aſſembled in the houſe of Michael Montio. Soone after they marched in their armes toward another bridge, which was nèere to the countrey of Bruſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> and there they deſcryed ſoone of their enemies, who then were comming to cut off that bridge. But perceiving the Proteſtants ready to reſiſt them, they returned back without any further attempt. On Sunday and Munday the Proteſtants ſtood upon their guard: on the Tuesday following in the evening came the enemies with a multitude of people, being accompanied with a great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Roman Catholikes of Bruſe. They ſet fire on the houſe of Anthonto Montino, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etro Ageſtino, and other houſes adjoyning. The proteſtants ſeeing ſo great a multitude of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, finding themſelves fewer in number, and weaker in ſtrength, ſome of them tooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their heeles, the reſt were ſlaine betwéen that evening and the next day.</p>
                  <p>There were ſlaine at that conflict twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven perſons, and among them theſe which follow.</p>
                  <p>Bettino of Azzala, ſonne of Pietro, of age fourty five yéers; Perrotta his wife, being of the age of fourty; Pietro their ſonne, being of age twelve yéeres; Andreino Zopo, ſonne of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notto, age fourty; Iames ſonne of Iohn Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menico, Quadernetto, age thirty. Iohn Mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatti, age fifty eight; Michaele della Koſa, age 38. Iacomena de Burieo, age thirty yéeres; Iean Moneta age eighty. This Woman was oftentimes adviſed to become a Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and to favour her age, telling her that if ſhée would, ſhée ſhould have her life given her: but ſhe with great reſolution replied, God forbid that I, who now of long time have had one foote in the grave, ſhould come to forſake my Lord Ieſus, who hath ſo long time preſerved me in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgè and confeſſion of his truth, and to put my truſt in creatures, and to receive in ſtead of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word the traditions of men. Upon which words this worthy Matron was inſtantly ſlaine.</p>
                  <p>Now there is no doubt but in this furious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution at Bruſe and in other places, there have béene murdered many good men for the foreſaid cauſe, whoſe names have not been mentioned in this diſcourſe: but whoſoever they were, they have departed with this comfort, that they have not ſuffered as murderers or robbers, or malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, or as buſie bodies in thoſe things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to them, but as holy Chriſtians, who at no hand would worſhip Images, they beleeved that the bloud of Chriſt hath purged them from all ſinne; That Chriſt hath offered one onely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice once for ſins; that we ought to worſhip the Lord God alone, and onely ſerve him; that wee are ſaved by grace, by the meanes of faith, and that not of our ſelves, the ſame being the gift of God, not by workes, to the intent none might boaſt; That we ought to worſhip God in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, holding up cleare hands unto him, that every creature of God is good, and none to be rejected, being uſed with thankſgiving; that mariage is honorable in every ſort and condition of perſons, according to the expreſſe words of the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique Scripture: and by reaſon of this very confeſſion were the inhabitants of Tyrano, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio, Sondro, Malenco, Berbenno, Trahono, Mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There was of late time a booke printed in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how the preteſtants of the aboveſaid places ſhould practiſe to execute upon the Catholiques, about the 15. day of Auguſt, the like, which ſince hath befalne themſelves: but how divelliſh a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and calumny this is, may cleer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Who then would beleeve that ſo ſmal a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhould be able to make reſiſtance againſt ſo great a multitude, and eſpecially againſt thoſe deſperate rebels, and outlawd villaines, who for their murders formerly committed, for their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the commiſſaries, and tranſgreſſions of the commandement of the Magiſtrate had before beene baniſhed out of the Country, being alſo ſuſpected of ſodomy, of falſification of money, and like ravening wolves, being throughly armed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred like a moſt furious torrent on the ſodaine, ſlaughtering the poore naked proteſtants, who ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65665:61"/> no ſuch wrong, even in thoſe Churches which before had béen priviledged even among the Barbarous Pagans, to the intent that they might put in execution that bloody deſigne which had béen reſolved on about 17. yéeres before, according to a Letter intercepted of a principall rebell in this action, who is neither afraid nor a ſhamed to terme the ſame a holy reſolution, and an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enterpriſe: which it is indéed, if to ſpoile, to rob, to ſtrangle, to maſſacre, to burn, to hew in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> péeces children and women, to caſt them into fire and water, to falſifie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith, ought to be accounted an attempt of holineſſe: if it ought to be eſtéemed a thing honorable and pleaſing to God, not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the bodies of the dead, being buried in the earth and in the Church, to reſt quietly, but to take them up againe, and being taken up to handle them in moſt barbarous manner (as very lately had béen done in the Countries of Caſpano and Trahone and in other places, where the bodies dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of the ground, which before were entire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and whole, were throwne into rivers and water, to be meat for the fiſhes) and having bruiſed and ground their bones to powder, moſt barbarouſly to caſt them into the fire. But here, if ever, the old tale of Aeſop is verified, where the poore ſilly ſhéepe was accuſed to have troubled the water of a malitious wolfe, although the ſaid ſhéep dranke below at the foot of the river.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it appeareth moſt clearely every way, that the aforeſaid perſons underwent thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſufferings for no other cauſe, but only for the truth of the Goſpell; even as by the eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée of God, the holy Prophets, Saint Io: Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſta, the holy Apoſtles, yea even our Lord and head Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, and after him thoſe many millions of the elected martyrs in all ages have done before, and eſpecially in theſe miſerable laſt times, in Germany, France, England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Low-countries, Bohemia, Italie, Spaine, Portugall, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Which martyrdome they endured willingly, rejoycing that they were counted worthy to ſuffer blame for the name of Chriſt Ieſus, remembring the promiſe of this our Lord, <hi>Bleſſed are they who</hi>
